I myself actually do not have a MacBook and am now considering buying one. For me the MacBook Air M2 visually very chic especially in the dark color. What�s also very charming is the MacBook is very light in weight and has no active cooling. So it is completely silent. However, I don't know how the performance would be without active cooling if I were to take part in a meeting with the camera activated via teams or use Final Cut from time to time....

If I hadn't seen some comparison videos now, I would buy MacBook Air M2 in the midnight color and additionally selected the larger GPU (10-core) incl. 16 GB RAM and 1 terabyte SSD. That would put the price at 2309 EUR. But now some say that you can directly get the MacBook Pro 14 inch, because I it costs 170 EUR more I guess and has more power and active cooling.
Now I am undecided ??.
I would use the MacBook privately and sometimes for work: Surfing, do office work (Word, Excel or even sometimes participate in meetings via teams) very rarely edit music or edit the one or other video with Final Cut.
I think the MacBook Air M2 with my configuration is enough, right?,1,Ali,2022-06-15T17:44:36Z,0,0.0,0.6043506493506494,0.1673051948051948;;"

488,"Let me tell you the best in class use case. Back in 2015 I bought an Intel Macbook pro 15 inch on an in store deal for approx 1950. Back then, I needed portability due to the way the tech world was with office work and client visits. in 2020 we had the pandemic, and the world changed where we could work remotely, in fact it was encouraged. All of a sudden I could comfortably get by with having desktop. I then sold my 2015 Intel Macbook pro for 500 to a DJ. I bought an M1 Mac Mini for 550 and a used like new 32 inch AOC 4k monitor for 350. I had vouchers from work on Amazon as a bonus and used that to buy a Keychron keyboard, a Logitech MX Master and a Dprofy soundbar. 

Honestly, I have no intention to change for a good while no matter how many events Apple has. That is how you get the optimum out of Apple without spending too much.

500,The 13-inch existence has to do with IT departments having tons of them and knowing the machine already.

1076,Part of the reason for not giving as many options for the color is pretty obvious. Stationary iMacs can be painted on aluminum without a fear of scratching and the paint coming off.

It is like MS and Apple said ""fuck it, we use it so heavy that people dont know what is a function/feature anymore"". And I hate that aproach the industry have taken to heart. Like in Win10, in settings, it took me 30 minute to figure out that a line of text were like a button or something. When things are that heavily used, it is bad for the user experience.

IMHO  moving to the M2 in the MB 13in Pro was a no brainer plus its would be strange if the Pro was less powerful than the Air and could do less stuff.Who would buy the 13in Pro??? Perhaps Apple had to guarantee its developers that the touchbar would remain for likely Pro Apps until its dropped from them all. So it had to still sell the smaller/""lighter"" 13in MBP.

1444,"It's a little frustrating to me that people have these assumptions that all creative professionals will automatically buy the more expensive M1 Pro or M1 Max models and therefore there's no value on the M2 13 inch MacBook Pro update. There are plenty of photographers and others like me who are interested in finding the best performance and user experience at the most cost effective level, especially if it's required for your business to be efficient and profitable. The $500+ plus difference between the M2 13"" MBP and the M1 Pro 14"" MBP is a considerable chunk of change for a self employed photographer, which could be better spent on lenses or other gear. I'm not saying I wouldn't love an M1 Pro or Max laptop, but I wouldn't discredit the M2 MBP entirely for those who need sustained performance at the lowest price.

That said, I do think the M2 Air is the more intriguing machine now, although I find it hard to justify the price increase given the measly 8GB of memory and 256GB storage.

And my opinion is strongly the second, as Apple wasn't so diffused a few years back... - same goes within its lineup. _MOST_ people who buy the Pro is because they want the pro/serious image, and those buy the Air want to have the more air/traveller image.... the price is not really a problem, 1400 or 1600 doesn't really make a difference, does it?

Gone is the flimsy aluminum that makes a popping sound every time I pick up my MB Pro, I now have a touch screen and great pen for drawing game characters, it's thinner and lighter than even the latest MB Air; it's a tablet, a laptop and a desktop PC � with an ability to use eGPU for monsterous desktop performance.

It' partly because of the inflation, the value of the dollar has dropped by ~8% so if you wanted to buy the M1 you should pay 1087$ instead of 999$(so the fact that the price stayed stable is the discount from Apple XD). However Apple is taking advantage of the fact that the demand would be high and jacked up the price for the M2 by ~100$ compared  to the first gen apple silicon (the M1 had an ""introduction"" price).,1,?????? ?????????????????,2022-06-09T13:15:21Z,0,0.0,0.3244444444444443,0.1366666666666667;;"

1932,As the owner of a matte black Razer Blade 14 I can say the best way to deal with the finger print thing is to just cover it entirely with finger prints. Just touch it all over until individual fingerprints disappear and it gets it's matte black look back. What I'm more concerned about is the colour coming off near the connector ports in the video. Those laptops were brand new and already showed signs of the colour scratching off near the USB C ports...hmmm.

The first is the 'decoy pricing' many ppl have stated. The second I think is because the Apple silicon refresh cycle is a bit messy - because the M1 Pro and Ultra came out a whole year after the M1, what they need to say now is that the M2 is better than a chip from 2 yrs ago but *not* better than last year's chip...which is weird.
Plus having two ""Pro"" laptops with almost the same size (14"" vs 13.6"") makes no sense so I'm guessing they will align this to the M2 Pro next year or kill off the line.,1,Abdul Rahman Noor,2022-06-09T12:54:28Z,0,0.0,0.3687500000000001,0.0083333333333333;;"

I find this funny that they always try to create line between an everyday user and a professional user instead of saying �essentially we were using less or equally powerful laptop as MBA m1/m2 to make these reviews, so yeah you can use it professionally�
Basically no matter how much they try most of them cannot get into the shoe of an avg user with tight budget who is working professionally and thriving financially using m1 base laptop which these reviewers deem to be for web browsing and not for so called YT professionals.
I guess thats cz they never had to squeeze the so called base model as they always have access to the latest models and subconsciously they are satisfying their own purchase of the m1 pro laptops although even they dont need m1pro to edit a 4k 10min review.

2333,I'm not sure what is happening to Apple. First they show a middle finger to their customers for long years with iOS 16 by removing so many phones and practically  removing their customers and moving them to competition and now they are doing the same to MacBook Pro customers. I mean you can cool externally with a fan stand if that is the only plus. Maybe they got so rich that they no longer care and is a good thing that they are on a verge of a downward spiral.

2356,The real question about the lineup is where the iPad air really fits in. If it can be placed properly in the Airline of products things make better sense in terms of the air serving nonpros as a continuous spectrum of products leading to the pro line with the Mac studio and the MacBook pro being the next steps up. The iPad Air actually sits between the M1 MacBook  Air and the M2 MacBook Air. This gives you air features and laptop capabilities depending on your use case. But I really think the iPad gets paired as a second device to whichever laptop you have not as a standalone unit unto itself. This is why running macOS on it makes no sense. If you want to run Pro Apps then get an M2 MacBook and keep the iPad for review and approvals or for prototyping and concept generation and content consumption. If you have an M1 then it is the carry-around on-the-go solution when you don't create or need a lot of typing.  It's too expensive when you add a pen and a keyboard to it compared to a laptop so don't make it one.

My main point is that an extra 2 ports would cost apple very little to implement, but they haven't done it, presumably to drive people to the Pro line. Same with the single display limit. I understand why it is done but it is still quite annoying, as I don't really need the power of a pro chip but have to spend the extra money for I/O features that are present on windows laptops half the price. Still, that is the apple way! And at least now there is magsafe so that a port isn't being used for just power.,0,Robert Hunt,2022-06-14T11:00:28Z,0,,0.3349489795918368,-0.0326318027210884;;"
2384,"@Robert Hunt for that use case you described here, Air is not the best option. For many other use cases for musicians, it is. Many of Apple users already have dongles purchased so there's no extra cost for getting some extra ports if needed. And I'm really not buying that latency argument, if you route your audio interface through a dongle or a dock. Any data on that?

The reason to buy an Air is definitely portability. If you move around a lot e.g., you're a dj, Air could be the perfect solution for you. In your case, it might not.

It baffles me people don't understand that there are lots of different use cases people have and I was pointing out musician requiring a portable solution with enough spec to run music production software. For that use case, Air is a great option for many. Not for all, but for many.

2541,"Marques, I think you forgot that the 13"" macbook pro is still the best selling macbook pro by a huge margin. That is why they are limited on changing it too much. For now I assume. There is a huge segment of the market that hates the new design still. Chances are they have manufacturing contracts to fullfill with the older design still and back-log on manufacturing with that design especially with their rapid switch to cutting off intel. Apple is really dropping the ball in making the air without a 15"" option and moving pro to 15"" default and 17"" or more for higher end models. 13"" in 2022 feels super small really. These screens aren't much different than the largest ipad pro screen size and the ipad pro's honestly have a better looking screen without any doubt. Prices went up realistically due to the cost of manufacturing right now. Inflation is really bad. I work for a tech/power company (huge in every industry) and people cannot even fathom just how bad the supply chain and costs all around are. IT'S REALLY BAD.

My current laptop has a ton of scratches, dents and smudges, but each one tells a story and I wouldn't have my laptop any other way.

They are as unique as fingerprints. Each set of smudges, scratches and dents represents a unique personality and a unique story of friendship and partnership between the device and the user.

2824,"Apple employee here! adding M2 chip to the mac book pro was unexpected for us. 
That was the las minute decision taken by the management team without informing the software team. Basically, hardware team is so confident that m1 chips can be easily replaced with M2 and that needs no additional testing. So there is no prototype for a MacBook pro with M2 yet. This decision was take to sell all the old hardware that was stock piled.

The plan for the cips are as follows
M2 - iPad pro, iPad air, Mac book Air, Mac mini
M2 pro - Mac book pro -14 & 16, iMac, Mac Studio
M2 max - Mac book pro -14 & 16, iMac, Mac Studio, Mac Pro

2855,"Seems that comments about excessive pricing do not account for the cost issues facing every manufacturer of most any worthy item these days. Component shortages translate into manufacturing cost increases, compounded on top of the more generalized price increases we are all experiencing to an astonishing degree.  Apple's shift from prior anticipated pricing norms reflects the reality of running a successful business in these current poorly managed economic conditions.
As a consumer, an approach to coping with the problem is to future-proof purchases with upgrades that are likely to extend useful life.  So the M2 MB Air I order will likely be quite more expensive than the base, but yet a trivial price in my view since squeezing 13 years out of the trusty magsafe 5-pound aluminum tricked-out MBP with which I am composing this comment (yet destined, finally, to be retired by that worthy alternative)...its age a clear reflection of my own.

I�m torn between Midnight and Space Gray here.

You're also right, PCs work a little better than before, but as I told you, that ""Frankenstein"" factor and constant virus scanning is a big no for me. I still have nightmares about ""ctrl+alt-del"" because Windows gets stuck and never recovers no matter how powerful the PC is. 

I like to be organized and I like Apple's approach to minimalism. Windows look and feel seems stuffy to me.

3073,"@Peter_Shadow As an artist myself, Surface Pro 8 is so much better than Macbooks for me personally; it has touch and pen, makes a lot of difference.

Not sure how long it's been since you used Windows before, but it's come a long way. Everything just works and the hardware (at least in case of Surface) is premium and beautifuf. Windows 11 is quite elegant too, MacOS feels very inconsistent and unfinished to me, it never started making that much sense even after 6 years of using it. 

For instsnce, why is it that CMD + X and CMD + V does work for cutting and pasting EVERYWHERE except Finder? Why do I have to remember a special cutting key combination CMD + Option + C (I think it was?) to do the same thing just there? 

Speaking of crap files, why does MacOS not remove all the files when I remove an application? I have HALF of my SSD filled in this mysterious section called ""Other"" when I look at the storage manager. After a lot of Googling and folder exploring I discovered that I have my Mac littered with old files from old programs that MacOS hasn't bothered to remove despite me uninstalling the software assosiacted with the files long ago. It's impossible to remove all of the files since I have no clue where everything is, what is important and what isn't � this has happened with multiple software and is super annoying.

Then I hate that some apps do not maximize properly. It's inconsistent. Like Lightroom does maximize, but Photoshop doesn't. I guess this has to do with the developers themselves, but in Windows when I press that same button I know exactly what's going to happen. Same goes for the X button, how it works on MacOS is highly inconsistent, some apps minimize for no clear reasoning while some apps close.

Windows has its own share of BS, but MacOS feels like multiple people programming a software and nobody communicating to each other, resulting in a total mess. 

I suppose these are matters of taste, I can understand why people do like Macs. It's an experience all the way from unboxing to using the device.

Many errors also happen because the applications we use are not ready for a new operating system. In 15+ years using Apple absolutely no problems other than that.

I really think they need to just come out with a brand new from scratch OS and then do 2-3 years of supporting both Win 11 and Win X before sunsetting Win 11 and using just the new OS from that point on. I know legacy support is important to them, but I think it holds them back a lot, too. Windows 8 I think was an attempt at that, but the backlash scared them into backing off where they were trying to go.

I couldn't draw a stick figure if my life depended on it, so I admit I'm not at all graphically knowledgable, but for touch and pen input wouldn't the iPad Pro be the better interface? I understand not wanting to have two devices if it could be avoided, but I thought Photoshop itself was just released for iPad. Like I imagine your computer interactions would fall into two distinct categories: 1) interacting with the system; 2) doing the drawing/art related stuff. I can't imagine pen + touch being better for interacting with the system itself (sending an email, changing settings, etc), but the actual drawing/creative work itself I'm sure is drastically improved by pen/touch compared to mouse/keyboard. 

Because of this, I think what Apple is doing with Continuity has so much potential. I can be using my Mac to type emails/send invoices; but then ideally I could fire up whatever art program I need to do creative work in and it would automatically activate the iPad so that I could use that touch/pen interface for that purpose. 

But again, I am not a graphic artist at all, so I am admittedly talking from outside the domain (I do software programming and dabble in music, but I suck at art).,1,Tommy Craft,2022-06-09T22:01:59Z,0,,0.4919536271808999,0.3328512396694215;;"
3099,"More likely just want to get rid of spare bodies and components in production, Mainly in chip and component shortage it�s a great choice to do. 

And off course changing the price doesn�t make sense for many reasons - Apple kept the price of the basic 1299 MBP since 2017 when they first released two versions of Macbook pro, it would be strange if they just suddenly shifted from years ahead planned pricing program. Second reason is simply because Air could never be more expensive than Pro because of the naming, that is why Macbook Pro stays even though it sells less it will probably sell enough for it to help with getting rid of spare parts and it is not going to burden the production problems of chips.

And honestly Apple �Wants to build and sell tons of Airs at high margins� is not really the case, the new Air has definitely the lowest margin from any of the 3 low grade computers Apple sells right now. 
The goal is to sell as many M1 Macbook Airs as possible because those are going to be some of the highest margin devices with the time they have been in production and that is the main reason why the new Air is 1199� to make the older one seem like a great deal and at the same time boosting margins in creation of a new device Apple has done the same thing in 2018 with the release of the first retina Macbook Air.

The operating system itself is well optimized for touch now even without tablet mode (it makes much more sense that there is no separate tablet mode, IMO), I rarely use the device with keyboard and pen if I'm not docked � it's actually enjoyable as a tablet, and I've used a bunch of iPads and Android tablets in the past.

But app support for touch is still kinda meh. Many of the pro software I've used work weird with touch � photoshop is an exception, they actually have gestures for things like undo, which is super handy.

And I can see why you would think touch is pointless, but as a graphic designer touch + pen is a must-have feature compared to trackpad or mouse.

And before you attack by the common ""Intel chips are trash"" I will say: YES! Apple silicon is better. But SP8 can handle EVERYTHING I've throw at it despite that and it offers options that Apple isn't offering. I've even tried pushing it and playing some older AAA-games. Games like MGS V runs FHD 60fps no problem for instance � kinda crazy for a computer that is even slimmer and lighter than MB Air.,1,PhazonBlaxor,2022-06-09T14:36:07Z,6,,0.6423976608187134,0.1048245614035087;;"

3292,"Apple most likely makes more money of a $1499 Air than a $1499 Pro. One of the Pros, on his list was size/weight. The Air being smaller takes less aluminum to build and that would cut the cost. The Air also has a smaller or not as high quality battery, the higher quality or more quantity of lithium would cause the Pro to cost more to make. The cost of fans, this is probably a not as costly, but is some what costly, and also is a contributor to needing a bigger laptop which goes back to more aluminum. Marques said that he up graded the Air to make them the same price, in reality; Apple offers a version of the M2 Air for $1499 (M2 8core CPU, 10core GPU, 8gb Unified Memory (Ram), 512gb SSD storage). The M2 Pro also has an option for $1499 (M2 8core CPU, 10core GPU, 8gb Unified Memory (Ram), 512gb SSD storage). These are the exact same stats almost. The fans are going to allow better performance continually. Also the Marques has the ports as better on the M2 Air, they actually have the exact same ports, except the M2 Pro has not mag port.

I can tell you that the M2 Pro is a better deal if you do light video editing or creating, you might want 16gb ram though, but you would need that upgrade on both making them the same price. Creators are not using a webcam either or the mics; although, the mics on the M2 Pro are better, they are 3 studio quality mics, the Air's 3 mics are not studio quality, or Apple would list it as such.

By the time you've looked at perhaps 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage, neither of which are outlandish specs, you're getting pretty close to the 14"" in price which unless you're desperate for an incredibly lightweight machine is a far more capable machine than a specced out Air.  Better processor, no throttling, better, bigger display etc.  Also likely to stay fast for longer and be worth far more for resale.  TBH, I don't stretch my 14"" but I still feel it was probably the right choice long term to swallow hard and pay the money.

3332,yep it's a UX thing as well. A lot of companies are using this trick to make us buy more. Also price anchoring is used as well where they show you a bigger price at first and then a smaller one which we always tend to think it's a better deal but in fact we are paying a premium.
3333,On paper the Air is cheaper than the MBP but in the air you only get the 8 core GPU and it is a 100$ upgrade to the 10 core and the pro already has that so for the same spec they cost the same.

3422,On the price issue - if you think about how many gallons of gas you could buy for $999 a couple of years ago compared to now ... then the new M2 MBA is less than half the price of the older M1 MBA at launch.  A dollar isnt a dollar anymore.
3423,13 inch Macbook Pro is probably just a way for Apple to clear out their stock of touchbar variant hardware since they probably believe it was better than having a function row before the redesign

3583,@User I feel that having a fan (cooling system) along with such bumped up specs is sort of necessary for a prolonged life of the device. I agree with you on the additonal slots as well
3584,"And it has a better contrast, OLED like, miniLED screen, adaptive 120hz refresh rate, HDMI and SD card slots, 3 USB-C with dual sided charging, thinner bezels, slightly larger screen, likely better performance and beefier GPU, 2 fans for active cooling and the ability to run a dual monitor setup.

3657,I�m honestly more curious about the durability of the finish on the midnight model. And I feel it would look nicer with a skin since it would look less too tone that you get with space grey with a black skin. That being said space grey has always been my go too for Apple devices for a long time so I�m a bit torn. But the M2 Air looks like a decent entry MacBook with plenty of power for work and general use.

3667,"@Defining Slawek the display on the 16� is amazing. I don�t know how the M1 Pro and M2 compare, I�d assume M1 Pro is still significantly better, but I�d say the main advantage to the 14� would be the display and speakers. However, I think it�s only slightly thinner than my 16� which is already pretty chunky. This is really weird but if you get the 14�, prepare for your computer to be fat shamed. 
The silver, the black keyboard, and the black screen when off look really nice together. The silver also makes the computer feel smaller.

3707,"Straight up I think Apple just bungled product release. 

I was expecting the MacBook Air to debut with the same colors as the M1 iMac lineup from last spring. And for the MacBook Pro to look like the lineup we�re getting with the M2 MacBook Air. Such a variety falls in line with the same color scheme Apple releases with the iPhone and iPhone pros. 

I think this has a lot to do with the supply chain issues that have been affecting the whole industry. Apple which has been able to stay ahead is now In the same boat as its competitors. Because Apple always feels the need to have to release something eye-catching during the developer conference, I think they prematurely released this line Under pressure To get new products out to market to maintain its profit margins.,1,Brian Castro,2022-06-09T02:06:16Z,0,1.0,0.3134680134680134,0.1151515151515151;;"

If you're a developer xcode is 40gb
MacOS itself is 40gb installed

If you're a photographer or video editor then you're probably working off a dongle because your files are on a card. Raw photos are 40mb and if you shot 2000 photos that's 80gb. And 1 hour 4k video is 3 gb. So say you're doing all of that, that's ~160gb.

3956,Totally agree that the M2 MacBook Air is a better overall package than the M2 MacBook Pro 13 this time around.  Apple clearly was not ready to overhaul the MacBook Pro 13 body as it would have at least received the MagSafe port. The only change was the chip and that did not require a body change.   M2 MacBook Air was the priority

4036,Debating if I should get the M2 Air
4037,Midnight please.!
4038,I�m curious why you like a dedicated function bar instead of the Touch Bar. Can you share any thoughts on that? I�ve always found the Touch Bar to be pretty sweet. Not sure what I�m missing.
4039,Fingerprints overload on the Midnight Air. That's what I assumed
4040,Starlight gets my vote. Also I�m going to wait for them to update the whole pro line ro M2 then consider updating. Dont really have an issue with Midnight personally.
4041,I'm wedged I'm Between the Silver or the starlight maybe even the space grey but i already have a space grey air so want something new hence either the starlight or the silver
4042,"I'm waiting until I can see it in real life. I remember hearing from someone that the watch in starlight could look a bit weird under most lighting conditions, but from the photos it looks beautiful.

4062,I�m here in the comments because of the sensor dust
4063,the M2 pro announcement also bugged the hell out of me. I would have been less annoyed if they just killed that model.
4064,Sorry MKBHD. 1199$ is the new 999$ in terms of inflation. I�m surprised apple isn�t charging more honestly considering all the inflation.
4065,The design is not better. It's got a notch come on. Agreed its not a major issue but it means the design is worse.

4071,I saw a side by side comparison between the air and pro 13 and it actually looked almost similar in real life. Well if you go �budget� at their base pro 13 has that 2 more GPU. I guess I wouldn�t jump the gun but just wait for more real word reviews and comparisons after a month later.
4072,you need to clean your camera lens lol
4073,Personally
4074,@anindita basak Whatever the model would be called

4083,@TheGlenGarrys i said personally dont like that aesthetic. It looks gaudy. If you like it
4084,Oh shut up about the notch already .. like it matters to anyone other than Apple haters hanging on to something to hate on ??????
4085,HATE the notch. That's already enough of a reason to not buy this. Price increase just makes it easier to not want it.
4086,Why still no touchscreen. And get rid of that notch. Touch ID works fine. Will stick with XPS 13.
4087,Apple should have ditched that 13in Macbook Pro.  It is not a worthy upgrade at all and feels out of place in the lineup and there is the 14in Macbook Pro which is a lot better in terms of performance (albeit more expensive of course).  The fans and larger battery bank dont make a significant difference because the M1 Macbook Air was just as good as the M1 Macbook Pro even way back in 2020 in real world usage.
4088,Im pretty sure this video was edited on that new macbook air
4089,For a guy who a naked phone. Midnight it is!

4091,Space Grey might be the option still
4092,"Do the midnight blue for your test. We already know what Silver and Grey and gold looks like why duplicate efforts. Also it would be helpful to me at least to see how photo editing such as layering and somewhat intensive or ram heavy workloads compare to the macbook pro 14"". I am looking at 16gb ram and 512gb hd with baseline chip for either air or the pro 14"" which with those specs would be the baseline pro. Not sure if the $400 is worth it or if the air can handle photo editing with Adobe elements or some mid tier editing software or will it be painful and just go with the pro or is pro only be marginally better than the air at those specs....,0,Glenn Ellis,2022-06-09T00:57:52Z,6,0.0,0.4535353535353535,-0.0636363636363636;;"

I see no reason to pick up the Pro 13 over the new Air or Pro 14. I guess you would only get it if you absolutely cannot stand having a notch on your laptop.

4288,I agree 95% but I prefer the wedge shape of the M1 Air to make the front keyboard/touchpad edge less intrusive. I also have the M1 Ultra 16 inch MacBook Pro and dislike the thickness and sharp front edge on my hands and wrists. It�s still some of that classic Apple form over function poor choices left over from the Jobs era. How hard would it be to radius the front edge in their machining process?

4290,I enjoy the Touch Bar as well! Was so sad when they took it away from the newest Pro Model Mac books :(

My interpretation is that Apple seems to be using the baseline M2 MacBook Pro as a decoy to push people towards either end of the spectrum. People who want the convenience for a bargain will be pushed to buy the M2Air for slightly cheaper, which will likely provide higher higher margins than the pro for Apple. People who really seek performance are likely to go M1Pro or Ultra (maybe M2 pro or ultra when/if that is unveiled) which moves customers up the pricing ladder.

While I do use FCP and Motion every once and a while for motion graphics or prototyping, it�s not often and it�s handled those situations very well.

4544,"I had the exact same thought while watching the keynote about the M2 MB pro. Seems like an insanely niche audience. Weird they didn�t update the design of it either. From what I can tell, it�s the only �recent� MacBook with the older design and what not.

They should have updated the bezels, added M2 with active cooling, MagSafe, and a 1080p camera. Then it would be a reasonable upgrade. But for me, with its current specs, design, and appearance, it�s not even a consideration. I would either do the M2 air for $1200 or the 14� MB Pro with M1 Pro for $2k. 
The M2 MB pro just seems like it�s in limbo� like if it was a 2 year old device already that just needed the updated design and such, that�s what it seems like; but it�s �brand new��
Very, very odd of Apple. 

I think it�s time for a CEO change. Bring in someone younger, that wants to release feature packed software/hardware, that wants to make �pro� devices pro, give us some extra pro software to go along with our �pro� hardware.

+ My other thought is that Apple currently has as wide portfolio of premium laptops as it can ever have. There is almost no price gap between each models whatsoever, it only depends on if you're willing to spend an additional $100 for higher-end model or if you're good with bigger RAM or storage at the same model.

I am getting a new macbook air because my 2015 Pro is done for though I love it but it would be nice to handle a faster machine with a battery that is not swelling. I would totally go for a Pro but the prices are crazy and in the end I am not a professional who will ever need that much performance. I would just get a mac mini if I needed too.

4805,"How To Go To Heaven
������It is very simple to be saved and takes only a minute to explain.�Please let me show you how to get�to�Heaven�from the Bible, God's Word...

Man is a�Sinner�in the Eyes of a Holy God.

Isaiah 53:6, �All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.�Romans 3:19, �Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the�world may become guilty before God.�John 3:3, �Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.�Romans 3:10, �As it is written,�There is none righteous, no, not one.�Romans 3:23, �For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.�

There�is a Price For Our Sin?Burning in Hell Forever.��

Romans 6:23, �For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.�Romans 5:12, �Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and�death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.�2nd Thessalonians 1:8, �In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.�Revelation 20:15, ""And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was�cast into the lake of fire.�Revelation 21:8, �But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in�the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.�

Jesus paid that price�by dying�on�the cross�and shedding His blood; Christ was buried and bodily rose again the third day!

Romans 5:8, �But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,�Christ died for us.�John 3:16, �For God so loved the world, that�he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.�1st Timothy 1:15, �This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that�Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.�1st Peter 1:18-19, �Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not�redeemed�with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;�But with the precious blood of Christ...�1st Corinthians 15:1-4,��Moreover, brethren,�I declare unto you�the gospel�which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that�Christ died�for our sins according to the scriptures; And that�he was buried, and that�he rose again the third day�according to the scriptures.� This is the Gospel.

By faith in Jesus Christ�ALONE�we�are immediately�saved.Galatians 3:26, �For ye are all the children of God�by faith in Christ Jesus.�John 11:25, �Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life:�he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.�John 6:28-29, �Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them,�This is the work of God, that ye believe on him�whom he hath sent.�Ephesians 2:8-9, �For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.�John 14:6, �Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father,�but by me.�John 6:40, �And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son,�and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.�Mark 1:15, �And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand:�repent ye, and believe the gospel.�Acts 26:18, �To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified�by faith that is in me.�Romans 10:13, �For whosoever shall call upon the�name of the Lord�shall be saved.�1st Corinthians 3:11, ""For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid,�which is Jesus Christ.�Galatians 3:26, �For ye are all the children of God�by faith in Christ Jesus.�

Salvation is NOT found in a religion or good works, but in a�Person...�The LORD JESUS CHRIST!

I know, programmers usually are known to hate the Touch Bar, but there were a lot of unique functionality that are hard to find on non-Touch Bar MacBooks. I liked that when you are debugging code in Xcode, it allows you to pause/set breakpoints/etc without it in focus. The screenshot taking button on Touch Bar is excellent and much better than memorizing hotkeys. And the spelling completion on the Touch Bar makes typing emojis much more seamless than having to do Cmd-Ctrl-Space on a regular keyboard. Some programming apps also have custom support for Touch Bar as well so you can add buttons to do the things you want. Oh well, I think the boat has sailed.

On the pricing front for M2, it's important to note that the M2 MacBook Air isn't really cheaper than the MacBook Pro if you upgrade SSD / RAM to the same spec. It still puts the 13"" MacBook Pro at a really weird spot though, as pointed out.,1,BrotherCheng,2022-06-08T22:19:57Z,1,1.0,0.5766826923076922,0.1625;;"

4905,"Personally I'm not too fond of the new MacBook designs, the reason being that they feel very 90's esque, while that wave has come and went, it just seems as a way to do something unexpected, which imo is a huge Stepdown from previous generations innovative ideas. 

It is though interesting seeing apple switching from Jonathan Ives clean minimalist, durable and timeless designs over to computers which are more ""in"" or ""out"" and feels almost retro, which means that in a couple of years people are gonna be thinking macbooks of today look out of style because they are too in style with the trends of 2022 or imo the last couple of years. To me it seems as yet another weapon to nodge consumers to buy products more frequently, because they lost consumers on the right to repair loss.

I have been watching what Apple has been doing the last 10 years with a keen eye, and have been full of joy each time they kept on innovating. To me the peak has to be the release of the M1 Mac, where they simplified the computer down to 2 usbc ports, as well as iPhones getting simplified down to a wireless charger and complete minimalism. 

To me this seems like a huge step in the wrong direction of cables and clutter. The next few years we are probably gonna see a teardown of what I've has built over the last 10 years, in an attempt to create ""tech fashion"" where technology will get replaced like fashion every few seasons, not because of necessity, but because of greed by Apple. 

This comment has gotten very out of hand, and I just wanted to say that I didn't like the comparison between the two computers, beacuase it is very subjective.

5039,"Concerning the pricing and how Europeans (such as myself) are complaining about the price increases and many Americans telling us that we are forgetting about VAT not being included.

I posted this as a reply on a comment before but I would like to add it for everyone to see:


German here, let's do a quick calculation for everybody saying that we forget about VAT not being included.

MacBook Air M1 is 1199�: $999 + highest sales tax in the US (Tennessee 9.55%) = $1094,4045 which is 1.018,67� so 180.33�/ $193,74 cheaper.

Both can be bought cheaper if not bought directly from Apple but I chose consistent Apple pricing.

MacBook Air M2 is 1499�: $1199 + highest sales tax in the US (Tennessee 9.55%) = $1313,5045 which is 1.222,61� so 276,39�/ $296,94 cheaper.

The argument of forgetting about added VAT is totally invalid because it is still going to be way cheaper in the end. The least of you (which I think is a fair assumption to make) live in Tennessee, which has the absolute highest VAT. Even your highest VAT is almost exactly half of what German VAT is (19%).,1,pennerman,2022-06-08T22:00:37Z,0,0.0,0.4435897435897437,0.1348484848484848;;"

5189,@Harry S Not very. You can look it up. The only modification is pulling off the factory thermal pad and putting on a thicker one that connects the processor directly to the chassis as a giant heatsink. You could save the pad and put it back if you wanted to. Only downside is that the bottom of the case directly under the cpu can get pretty hot (40C+) which could burn you if you leave it on your lap for a long time. I work on a desk/table most of the time and its raised on its rubber feet so I don't have an issue with the heat.

When looking at the M1 Pro or Max chips, they are overkill for anyone who doesn't have a graphics-intensive workflow.

5325,"@Evsual ""because they've made the laptop itself significantly faster"" ...  Significantly faster? No they did not. This is a 2 year product cycle update, as people seem to forget that the M1 came out in 2020. Your getting 18% faster MT, what is mostly located on the E-Cores ( in other words, you do not feel any faster response there ). that increased 40% performance but those E-Cores are so dog slow from the start, even with 40% they are nowhere near useable for primary tasks. That leave you with the 4 Performance cores. The P-Cores are about 10% faster. Notice how Apple again mixes the marketing to fool people. 

The GPU has a 37% upgrade ( with a increased in power usage. Where its only a 25% if you want the same TDP). Given you have no fan, what do you think happens to a GPU that needs more power? Yep, it thermal throttles faster and that 37% will never be 37%. You need the Pro with the fan to get that benefit!

If we compare that to AMD 4800U to 6800U. They did a 28% faster ST, 46% faster MT, 115% faster GPU in that same timeframe. And they did not upgrade the OEM prices for those CPUs, while 16GB / 1TB has become a standard (aka free included ) feature on most laptops.

I am amazed at how little people understand of hardware and how easy they can be fooled to believe some marketing BS. O, M1 Max encodes as fast as a 3090. That means a M1 Max is as fast as a 3090 at gaming, right ( notice how Apple never answers those question and lets it up to the hype)? O, wait, it only performs as fast as a 1200 Euro laptop's 3050~3060 ranged with actual games because its 3060 like hardware with a great media encoder. Its easy to fool people when they do not do research and 90% of the youtubers constantly post only the good parts that Apple want them to focus on ( i wonder why? Might have something to do with Access to Apple and hardware? ;-0 ),1,Ben Jiro,2022-06-09T12:38:48Z,2,,0.5652116402116403,0.2190696649029982;;"

5327,@User I agree - this probably should be the base MBP lol. The whole point of the MBA is that it has been the 'default laptop' for most people for a long time (though recent years with quality control issues and crappy keyboard less so

5355,@Evsual If it was $200 here in Australia I'd agree with you. But here the price hike is $400. Faster performance and better screen is not going to be hugely noticeable for most Air users. And bringing back magsafe like it's a new feature is hardly a plus lol.
5356,Agree.  The m1 MacBook Air as apples baseline laptop starting at 1000 was already expensive
5357,@Nic_CCC I think it's worth it because they've made the laptop itself significantly faster
5358,100% agreed. I'd rather save and invest in the Pro 14-inch one tbh.
5359,@Omar Chaudhry well that�s a good point but I�ll still justify the price as it�s one of the thinnest laptops in its class.. if only the screen could better

I know - it pads profit margins and cons koolaid drinkers into buying two products when one would work.    The dark color is also nice.  I'm not surprised a snowflake like him would not like it.

6045,"@Jakob C German here, let's do a quick calculation for everybody saying that we forget about VAT not being included.

MacBook Air M1 is 1199�: $999 + highest sales tax in the US (Tennessee 9.55%) = $1094,4045 which is 1.018,67� so 180.33�/ $193,74 cheaper.

Both can be bought cheaper if not bought directly from Apple but I chose consistent Apple pricing.

MacBook Air M2 is 1499�: $1199 + highest sales tax in the US (Tennessee 9.55%) = $1313,5045 which is 1.222,61� so 276,39�/ $296,94 cheaper.

The argument of forgetting about added VAT is totally invalid because it is still going to be way cheaper in the end. The least of you (which I think is a fair assumption to make) live in Tennessee, which has the absolute highest VAT.

6222,@Scott Neidich yes. It does look strange
6223,@Sandeep Sengupta some shots have a discoloration on the mid-left side of the screen. Looks to me like sensor-burn in one of his cameras
6224,Actually looks like sensor because the framing is moving I believe due to the sensor IBIS and not IS on lens cause it'd move with the movement. Keen eye to catch that tho
6225,Yes
6226,i thought my s8 tab ultra broke already
6227,Feel ya
6228,Apple just isn't fair
6229,I thought I have dust in my eyes
6230,I was cleaning my screen but then it hit me.
6231,i feel ur pain bro.
6232,@Timothy Lu oh of course. Thank you
6233,Yeah i thought its in my screen
6234,@Sandeep Sengupta you'll see it at 0:41
6235,I can't find it?
6236,@jay Yeah it looks like it
6237,@Jail Bait did tou forget to take your meds or are you just a bot?
6238,I wish I hadn't seen this before I watched
6239,@jay It wouldn't move with the zoom if it was on the sensor. It's likely between on the backside of the lens or between lens elements (which is honestly where that stuff tends to live and it's impossible to easily get rid of).

6354,"@Maadaaraa I think that's the most likely outcome. I have a feeling the 13"" only still exists to squeeze another year out of the tooling & parts around. It'll probably go within the next couple of years.,1,certified opinion haver,2022-06-09T01:44:57Z,0,,0.625,0.125;;"
6355,I bet it a decision to simplify the supply chain.
6356,With the new Air looking like the new Pro
6357,if you compare the MacBooks of the same generation that's how it's always been the 2019 MacBook air and pro looked the same the pros just got the redesign first in 2021 we just had one odd year where they looked different 2020
6358,They even cost about the same when you spec the air with similar options

6530,And I was smudging my phone display -
6531,I want everything Mac  I have since the late 80s.  Luckily I have the right change to get what I want. I rest my case right here. And I make great strawberry
6532,I want everything Mac ok? I rest my case.
6533,I thought my pixel display broke . Thanks to your sensor dust xD
6534,I was gonna comment about that ??
6535,CANCELLED! Lol
6536,and if you put thermo pad in macbook air- perfomance will be almost the same whitout coolers

6543,No problem the video is still clear and we can't even see the dust lol
6544,Hi Marques. I think in the interest of viewers your should get the new matt black (midnight) one to really test and show the fingerprint issue.
6545,Didn't even notice until you pointed it out ??
6546,Ok so Marques
6547,I cringed for you hahaha. But then I thought
6548,ok
6549,Damn
6550,Wow
6551,But the mac book looks beautiful
6552,I actually cleaned my laptop screen.. I thought I got screen burn-in or something. You gave me a good scare with your video.
6553,?
6554,I thought my phone has a screen problem whicj scares me off
6555,Ok
6556,I was scared that my iPhone has a dead pixel. I literally go to dead pixel text and confirmed twice and relived that it�s not me
6557,I was surprised that the cameraman didn't notice it while filming. Should have switched it to iPhone on the spot
6558,Starlight coz we know ur a fan of the Boys
6559,Thinner is easy to be broken.
6560,Testing my sanity...
6561,Is that the dot you are referring to. Thought my screen was dirty at first. Lol
6562,????? I genuinely thought my screen was damaged
6563,Hahahahha
6564,I personally feel starlight is the best color. What say? Classy look
6565,dumb me thought that was on my display and tried to clean it ??????
6566,Still an epic video and first impressions review nonetheless!
6567,I wish I could buy it. i really like macbookpro
6568,Lol
6569,Where did you change the lens?! Tatooine? ??

6576,**some kinda of ai remove software be like am i a joke to you**
6577,It is kinda crazy that they didn't lower the M1 Air price. It has been 18 months
6578,Actually tried to wipe it off my screen ??
6579,Please test Midnight in depth. Looks very cool
6580,I was trying to clean my screen HAHAHAH
6581,@Anas Khan The WEDGE shape is what really differentiated the Air from Pro
6582,Its annoying.........
6583,No mention about 7MM DIFFERENCE in leading edge WEDGE HEIGHT? Typing wrist comfort benefit now gone FOREVER.
6584,didn't even notice it till i read this comment. thought it was gunk on my phone.
6585,Never seen sensor dust look like this!! I guess that�s a problem exclusively for red cameras?
6586,How do we fix it on the post?
6587,I was extremely paranoic my screen had dead pixels
6588,I love that you tried to hide it in darker areas like the black bezels and such. hahaha
6589,Getting used to notch
6590,this is too real lol
6591,@VINAY MAKIN ok
6592,All good. Happened to me once
6593,I like the midnight color but those fingerprints would drive me crazy too. I vote for space grey.

6628,didnt they JUST come out with the M1 chip? WTF?
6629,Loved the comparison with the M2 Pro. Can't wait for thorough review of new Webcam
6630,Midnight colour looks pretty good.
6631,M2 Air is far too expensive in Europe compared to the 'older' M1. The gap between the US price and the European is way too extreem. Starts at 1199$ vs 1519� in Europe.
6632,Its funny because everybody was hating on apple while steve jobs was alive..... But now they make little affordable gimmicky crap basic consumer electronics
6633,POST STEVE JOBS PLANET EARTH IS SHIT. STEVE JOBS IS MISSED. LONG LIVE STEVE JOBS.

I myself actually do not have a MacBook and am now considering buying one. For me the MacBook Air M2 visually very chic especially in the dark color. What�s also very charming is the MacBook is very light in weight and has no active cooling. So it is completely silent. However, I don't know how the performance would be without active cooling if I were to take part in a meeting with the camera activated via teams or use Final Cut from time to time....

If I hadn't seen some comparison videos now, I would buy MacBook Air M2 in the midnight color and additionally selected the larger GPU (10-core) incl. 16 GB RAM and 1 terabyte SSD. That would put the price at 2309 EUR. But now some say that you can directly get the MacBook Pro 14 inch, because I it costs 170 EUR more I guess and has more power and active cooling.
Now I am undecided ??.
I would use the MacBook privately and sometimes for work: Surfing, do office work (Word, Excel or even sometimes participate in meetings via teams) very rarely edit music or edit the one or other video with Final Cut.
I think the MacBook Air M2 with my configuration is enough, right?,1,Ali,2022-06-15T17:44:36Z,0,0.0,0.6043506493506494,0.1673051948051948;;"

7209,Not a single YouTuber or anybody at all going to point out that a 20% increase of price for 20% more performance is not an innovation but stagnation and is a load of bull? No one at all? okay.
7210,@Amirul i mean making that civic nowadays is more expensive because of inflation so technically yes it does make sense
7211,@MarvelBricked Will it make sense if I purchase a 2015 Honda Civic now for the same MSRP to when it came out? No. I don't think so.
7212,It�s just inflation of price for the new features that are awsome
7213,Midnight on the MacBook Air!! It�ll be worth the fingerprint hassle lol
7214,Starlight color ithink it will be better
7215,M2 Air is far too expensive in Europe compared to the 'older' M1. The gap between the US price and  the European is way too extreem. Starts at 1199$ vs 1519� in Europe.
7216,@Praneel Easwaran Just consider to fly to US and buy it there ??
7217,@David  What you're advocating right now is rugged individualism
7218,@HypeLevels The Euro is at near 15 year lows compared to the US Dollar. Wait until the Euro is worth LESS than the US dollar
7219,@Mark We also get BMWs in the US for approximately 50-80% less than the UK which is utterly bizarre given it's a German car.

True, but the average tax rate in the United States is 5.09%. If i'm well informed. That means that a basic Macbook M2 Air would cost $1199 + 5.09% tax = approximately $1260. So that's 1,198 Euros.

7604,Part of the reason for not giving as many options for the color is pretty obvious. Stationary iMacs can be painted on aluminum without a fear of scratching and the paint coming off.

He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can�t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated.

You can enter the app, but you can also reply in the notification. Like.... WTF???? I want things central and not spread out in multiple levels. But that bar is nothing, compared to flat design. It is like MS and Apple said ""fuck it, we use it so heavy that people dont know what is a function/feature anymore"". And I hate that aproach the industry have taken to heart. Like in Win10, in settings, it took me 30 minute to figure out that a line of text were like a button or something. When things are that heavily used, it is bad for the user experience.

IMHO  moving to the M2 in the MB 13in Pro was a no brainer plus its would be strange if the Pro was less powerful than the Air and could do less stuff.Who would buy the 13in Pro??? Perhaps Apple had to guarantee its developers that the touchbar would remain for likely Pro Apps until its dropped from them all. So it had to still sell the smaller/""lighter"" 13in MBP. Looking at the specs, I can see the 13in MBP being dropped first as the top end Air has the same specs (if not better and lighter). What customer needs a 10GPU M2 Macbook Air with a 2TB SSD/24GB RAM?

7972,"It's a little frustrating to me that people have these assumptions that all creative professionals will automatically buy the more expensive M1 Pro or M1 Max models and therefore there's no value on the M2 13 inch MacBook Pro update. There are plenty of photographers and others like me who are interested in finding the best performance and user experience at the most cost effective level, especially if it's required for your business to be efficient and profitable. The $500+ plus difference between the M2 13"" MBP and the M1 Pro 14"" MBP is a considerable chunk of change for a self employed photographer, which could be better spent on lenses or other gear. I'm not saying I wouldn't love an M1 Pro or Max laptop, but I wouldn't discredit the M2 MBP entirely for those who need sustained performance at the lowest price.

That said, I do think the M2 Air is the more intriguing machine now, although I find it hard to justify the price increase given the measly 8GB of memory and 256GB storage. Bump those up to a more reasonable starting size and the price would be easier to swallow.,1,Misterfilmguy,2022-06-09T20:09:57Z,0,1.0,0.5590579710144927,0.1643115942028985;;"

And my opinion is strongly the second, as Apple wasn't so diffused a few years back... - same goes within its lineup. _MOST_ people who buy the Pro is because they want the pro/serious image, and those buy the Air want to have the more air/traveller image.... the price is not really a problem, 1400 or 1600 doesn't really make a difference, does it?

8447,"Why the extra cost? It' partly because of the inflation, the value of the dollar has dropped by ~8% so if you wanted to buy the M1 you should pay 1087$ instead of 999$(so the fact that the price stayed stable is the discount from Apple XD). However Apple is taking advantage of the fact that the demand would be high and jacked up the price for the M2 by ~100$ compared  to the first gen apple silicon (the M1 had an ""introduction"" price).,1,?????? ?????????????????,2022-06-09T13:15:21Z,0,0.0,0.3244444444444443,0.1366666666666667;;"

8460,As the owner of a matte black Razer Blade 14 I can say the best way to deal with the finger print thing is to just cover it entirely with finger prints. Just touch it all over until individual fingerprints disappear and it gets it's matte black look back. What I'm more concerned about is the colour coming off near the connector ports in the video. Those laptops were brand new and already showed signs of the colour scratching off near the USB C ports...hmmm.

The first is the 'decoy pricing' many ppl have stated. The second I think is because the Apple silicon refresh cycle is a bit messy - because the M1 Pro and Ultra came out a whole year after the M1, what they need to say now is that the M2 is better than a chip from 2 yrs ago but *not* better than last year's chip...which is weird.
Plus having two ""Pro"" laptops with almost the same size (14"" vs 13.6"") makes no sense so I'm guessing they will align this to the M2 Pro next year or kill off the line.,1,Abdul Rahman Noor,2022-06-09T12:54:28Z,0,0.0,0.3687500000000001,0.0083333333333333;;"

I find this funny that they always try to create line between an everyday user and a professional user instead of saying �essentially we were using less or equally powerful laptop as MBA m1/m2 to make these reviews, so yeah you can use it professionally�
Basically no matter how much they try most of them cannot get into the shoe of an avg user with tight budget who is working professionally and thriving financially using m1 base laptop which these reviewers deem to be for web browsing and not for so called YT professionals.
I guess thats cz they never had to squeeze the so called base model as they always have access to the latest models and subconsciously they are satisfying their own purchase of the m1 pro laptops although even they dont need m1pro to edit a 4k 10min review.

8883,cuz the silver means basic apple and he doesn't wanna appear basic (which he is) so space gray makes you feel a pro
8884,The real question about the lineup is where the iPad air really fits in. If it can be placed properly in the Airline of products things make better sense in terms of the air serving nonpros as a continuous spectrum of products leading to the pro line with the Mac studio and the MacBook pro being the next steps up. The iPad Air actually sits between the M1 MacBook  Air and the M2 MacBook Air. This gives you air features and laptop capabilities depending on your use case. But I really think the iPad gets paired as a second device to whichever laptop you have not as a standalone unit unto itself. This is why running macOS on it makes no sense. If you want to run Pro Apps then get an M2 MacBook and keep the iPad for review and approvals or for prototyping and concept generation and content consumption. If you have an M1 then it is the carry-around on-the-go solution when you don't create or need a lot of typing.  It's too expensive when you add a pen and a keyboard to it compared to a laptop so don't make it one.

8911,"@Ville Siltala I agree this will be good for lots of people. The reason I say 2 ports is not enough is that both my interface and keyboard say they need direct connection, not a dock, but maybe that is the manufacturer being paranoid.

My main point is that an extra 2 ports would cost apple very little to implement, but they haven't done it, presumably to drive people to the Pro line. Same with the single display limit. I understand why it is done but it is still quite annoying, as I don't really need the power of a pro chip but have to spend the extra money for I/O features that are present on windows laptops half the price. Still, that is the apple way! And at least now there is magsafe so that a port isn't being used for just power.,0,Robert Hunt,2022-06-14T11:00:28Z,0,,0.3349489795918368,-0.0326318027210884;;"
8912,"@Robert Hunt for that use case you described here, Air is not the best option. For many other use cases for musicians, it is. Many of Apple users already have dongles purchased so there's no extra cost for getting some extra ports if needed. And I'm really not buying that latency argument, if you route your audio interface through a dongle or a dock. Any data on that?

The reason to buy an Air is definitely portability. If you move around a lot e.g., you're a dj, Air could be the perfect solution for you. In your case, it might not.

It baffles me people don't understand that there are lots of different use cases people have and I was pointing out musician requiring a portable solution with enough spec to run music production software. For that use case, Air is a great option for many. Not for all, but for many.

There is a huge segment of the market that hates the new design still. Chances are they have manufacturing contracts to fullfill with the older design still and back-log on manufacturing with that design especially with their rapid switch to cutting off intel. Apple is really dropping the ball in making the air without a 15"" option and moving pro to 15"" default and 17"" or more for higher end models. 13"" in 2022 feels super small really. These screens aren't much different than the largest ipad pro screen size and the ipad pro's honestly have a better looking screen without any doubt. Prices went up realistically due to the cost of manufacturing right now. Inflation is really bad.

My current laptop has a ton of scratches, dents and smudges, but each one tells a story and I wouldn't have my laptop any other way.

They are as unique as fingerprints. Each set of smudges, scratches and dents represents a unique personality and a unique story of friendship and partnership between the device and the user.

9352,"Apple employee here! adding M2 chip to the mac book pro was unexpected for us. 
That was the las minute decision taken by the management team without informing the software team. Basically, hardware team is so confident that m1 chips can be easily replaced with M2 and that needs no additional testing. So there is no prototype for a MacBook pro with M2 yet. This decision was take to sell all the old hardware that was stock piled.

The plan for the cips are as follows
M2 - iPad pro, iPad air, Mac book Air, Mac mini
M2 pro - Mac book pro -14 & 16, iMac, Mac Studio
M2 max - Mac book pro -14 & 16, iMac, Mac Studio, Mac Pro
M2 ultra - iMac, Mac Studio, Mac Pro (focused mainly on gaming and content creation)
M2 ultra is going to destroy the gaming PC industry. We have our internal benchmark tool and it shows around 5 times better performance when compared to the best PC money can buy.,1,rahul A,2022-06-09T05:23:54Z,0,0.0,0.4444444444444445,0.2888888888888889;;"

9383,"Seems that comments about excessive pricing do not account for the cost issues facing every manufacturer of most any worthy item these days. Component shortages translate into manufacturing cost increases, compounded on top of the more generalized price increases we are all experiencing to an astonishing degree.  Apple's shift from prior anticipated pricing norms reflects the reality of running a successful business in these current poorly managed economic conditions.
As a consumer, an approach to coping with the problem is to future-proof purchases with upgrades that are likely to extend useful life.  So the M2 MB Air I order will likely be quite more expensive than the base, but yet a trivial price in my view since squeezing 13 years out of the trusty magsafe 5-pound aluminum tricked-out MBP with which I am composing this comment (yet destined, finally, to be retired by that worthy alternative)...its age a clear reflection of my own.

In Macos Everything related to the applications is stored in the �library� �application support�, you delete the file and that's it.

Surface is very elegant and functional but if I were to buy a tablet it would be an iPad M1 that also has a pen and keyboard and is fast. 

You're also right, PCs work a little better than before, but as I told you, that ""Frankenstein"" factor and constant virus scanning is a big no for me. I still have nightmares about ""ctrl+alt-del"" because Windows gets stuck and never recovers no matter how powerful the PC is. 

I like to be organized and I like Apple's approach to minimalism. Windows look and feel seems stuffy to me.

9601,"@Peter_Shadow As an artist myself, Surface Pro 8 is so much better than Macbooks for me personally; it has touch and pen, makes a lot of difference.

Not sure how long it's been since you used Windows before, but it's come a long way. Everything just works and the hardware (at least in case of Surface) is premium and beautifuf. Windows 11 is quite elegant too, MacOS feels very inconsistent and unfinished to me, it never started making that much sense even after 6 years of using it. 

For instsnce, why is it that CMD + X and CMD + V does work for cutting and pasting EVERYWHERE except Finder? Why do I have to remember a special cutting key combination CMD + Option + C (I think it was?) to do the same thing just there? 

Speaking of crap files, why does MacOS not remove all the files when I remove an application? I have HALF of my SSD filled in this mysterious section called ""Other"" when I look at the storage manager. After a lot of Googling and folder exploring I discovered that I have my Mac littered with old files from old programs that MacOS hasn't bothered to remove despite me uninstalling the software assosiacted with the files long ago. It's impossible to remove all of the files since I have no clue where everything is, what is important and what isn't � this has happened with multiple software and is super annoying.

Then I hate that some apps do not maximize properly. It's inconsistent. Like Lightroom does maximize, but Photoshop doesn't. I guess this has to do with the developers themselves, but in Windows when I press that same button I know exactly what's going to happen. Same goes for the X button, how it works on MacOS is highly inconsistent, some apps minimize for no clear reasoning while some apps close.

Windows has its own share of BS, but MacOS feels like multiple people programming a software and nobody communicating to each other, resulting in a total mess. 

I suppose these are matters of taste, I can understand why people do like Macs. It's an experience all the way from unboxing to using the device.

I really think they need to just come out with a brand new from scratch OS and then do 2-3 years of supporting both Win 11 and Win X before sunsetting Win 11 and using just the new OS from that point on. I know legacy support is important to them, but I think it holds them back a lot, too. Windows 8 I think was an attempt at that, but the backlash scared them into backing off where they were trying to go.

I couldn't draw a stick figure if my life depended on it, so I admit I'm not at all graphically knowledgable, but for touch and pen input wouldn't the iPad Pro be the better interface? I understand not wanting to have two devices if it could be avoided, but I thought Photoshop itself was just released for iPad. Like I imagine your computer interactions would fall into two distinct categories: 1) interacting with the system; 2) doing the drawing/art related stuff. I can't imagine pen + touch being better for interacting with the system itself (sending an email, changing settings, etc), but the actual drawing/creative work itself I'm sure is drastically improved by pen/touch compared to mouse/keyboard. 

Because of this, I think what Apple is doing with Continuity has so much potential. I can be using my Mac to type emails/send invoices; but then ideally I could fire up whatever art program I need to do creative work in and it would automatically activate the iPad so that I could use that touch/pen interface for that purpose. 

But again, I am not a graphic artist at all, so I am admittedly talking from outside the domain (I do software programming and dabble in music, but I suck at art).,1,Tommy Craft,2022-06-09T22:01:59Z,0,,0.4919536271808999,0.3328512396694215;;"

And off course changing the price doesn�t make sense for many reasons - Apple kept the price of the basic 1299 MBP since 2017 when they first released two versions of Macbook pro, it would be strange if they just suddenly shifted from years ahead planned pricing program. Second reason is simply because Air could never be more expensive than Pro because of the naming, that is why Macbook Pro stays even though it sells less it will probably sell enough for it to help with getting rid of spare parts and it is not going to burden the production problems of chips.

And honestly Apple �Wants to build and sell tons of Airs at high margins� is not really the case, the new Air has definitely the lowest margin from any of the 3 low grade computers Apple sells right now. 
The goal is to sell as many M1 Macbook Airs as possible because those are going to be some of the highest margin devices with the time they have been in production and that is the main reason why the new Air is 1199� to make the older one seem like a great deal and at the same time boosting margins in creation of a new device Apple has done the same thing in 2018 with the release of the first retina Macbook Air.

But app support for touch is still kinda meh. Many of the pro software I've used work weird with touch � photoshop is an exception, they actually have gestures for things like undo, which is super handy.

And I can see why you would think touch is pointless, but as a graphic designer touch + pen is a must-have feature compared to trackpad or mouse.

Now the air does not even have the nice screen of the mbp, which is one of the main reasons i am even considering an apple laptop for the first time ever, the other reason being the m1.

9820,"Apple most likely makes more money of a $1499 Air than a $1499 Pro. One of the Pros, on his list was size/weight. The Air being smaller takes less aluminum to build and that would cut the cost. The Air also has a smaller or not as high quality battery, the higher quality or more quantity of lithium would cause the Pro to cost more to make. The cost of fans, this is probably a not as costly, but is some what costly, and also is a contributor to needing a bigger laptop which goes back to more aluminum. Marques said that he up graded the Air to make them the same price, in reality; Apple offers a version of the M2 Air for $1499 (M2 8core CPU, 10core GPU, 8gb Unified Memory (Ram), 512gb SSD storage). The M2 Pro also has an option for $1499 (M2 8core CPU, 10core GPU, 8gb Unified Memory (Ram), 512gb SSD storage). These are the exact same stats almost. The fans are going to allow better performance continually. Also the Marques has the ports as better on the M2 Air, they actually have the exact same ports, except the M2 Pro has not mag port. Also you are not getting more screen, the expansion from 13.3 to 13.6 is true but you will have a line at the top due to the cameras and sensor bar stuck in the middle. Do you really need a 1080p webcam? Do you like the Touch Bar? These are question you have to ask yourself. I can tell you that the M2 Pro is a better deal if you do light video editing or creating, you might want 16gb ram though, but you would need that upgrade on both making them the same price. Creators are not using a webcam either or the mics; although, the mics on the M2 Pro are better, they are 3 studio quality mics, the Air's 3 mics are not studio quality, or Apple would list it as such. Also the M2 Air has 4 speakers system, but the M2 Pro has Stereo Speakers with High Dynamic Rang, this is not in the description of the M2 Air.

By the time you've looked at perhaps 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage, neither of which are outlandish specs, you're getting pretty close to the 14"" in price which unless you're desperate for an incredibly lightweight machine is a far more capable machine than a specced out Air.  Better processor, no throttling, better, bigger display etc.  Also likely to stay fast for longer and be worth far more for resale.  TBH, I don't stretch my 14"" but I still feel it was probably the right choice long term to swallow hard and pay the money.

9860,yep it's a UX thing as well. A lot of companies are using this trick to make us buy more. Also price anchoring is used as well where they show you a bigger price at first and then a smaller one which we always tend to think it's a better deal but in fact we are paying a premium.
9861,On paper the Air is cheaper than the MBP but in the air you only get the 8 core GPU and it is a 100$ upgrade to the 10 core and the pro already has that so for the same spec they cost the same.

9904,@jdmasfuck I'm also still on a 2015 MBP right now. Still more than fast enough for me. I would take an Air for now if I had the money to switch. Love them.
9905,@Martijn van Gammeren yeah same..air is more than enough power for my basic use .. wish they made the apple logo glow again. i like it on my macbook pro 2015
9906,@jdmasfuck probably indeed. But the Air is for me the product that you want to be a bit silly with. I would have loved the green/red/yellow
9907,Yes! I want a MacBook Pro in cobalt blue or Project Red. Pros are probably video producers or musicians
9908,its marketing.. they will have colors later on the pros lol
9909,I'm sad that the new airs don't have the colours of the redisinged iMacs
9910,if the m2 pro 14 and 16 inch ones don't get midnight and starlight that will be so sad lol. The number of guys who would have went m2 pro 14 inch and will take an air instead lol
9911,Can the air do like  hardcore gaming Can you play like the citizen?

9931,So glad they got rid of Jonny Ives! So tired of my Intel MacPro 13-inch

9933,Space Grey

9948,I definitely  pick Starlight! To me the Midnight color seems more like a blue :(
9949,I have no idea why people are so hyped about it..
9950,On the price issue - if you think about how many gallons of gas you could buy for $999 a couple of years ago compared to now ... then the new M2 MBA is less than half the price of the older M1 MBA at launch.  A dollar isnt a dollar anymore.
9951,13 inch Macbook Pro is probably just a way for Apple to clear out their stock of touchbar variant hardware since they probably believe it was better than having a function row before the redesign
9952,The color trumps fingerprints.
9953,Love the midnight
9954,Get midnight
9955,Silver > everything else
9956,why don't we like silver?  its classic an clean looking.
9957,What gets even weirder is they increased the price old M1 MBA by 7k INR more than what it original launched for.

9975,Everything about the M2 MacBook Pro makes zero sense. I couldn�t believe what I was seeing when a saw that they left the Touch Bar on it too.
9976,Go for starlight
9977,Maybe it is Apple's strategy to make the Air seem more valued than the Pro
9978,Space grey its
9979,Everyone else is gonna go midnight. And we've seen the other colors. Starlight is really the main color of mystery. People can't really agree what color it is ??
9980,I still lean towards the M1 macbook air because of it's price. It has great performance and I don't really care about the outer body design.
9981,the main upgrade is for video editors (the media engine is taken from the m1pro) so if you don't plan on using that and you're not wanting to spend 200 dollars more on the new design
9982,I bought my M1 MacBook Air with 8/8 cores
9983,@Zombie Rofl Because I really prefer the physical buttons to the touch bar. Why pay more money for a feature that I find it worse?

10111,@User I feel that having a fan (cooling system) along with such bumped up specs is sort of necessary for a prolonged life of the device. I agree with you on the additonal slots as well
10112,"And it has a better contrast, OLED like, miniLED screen, adaptive 120hz refresh rate, HDMI and SD card slots, 3 USB-C with dual sided charging, thinner bezels, slightly larger screen, likely better performance and beefier GPU, 2 fans for active cooling and the ability to run a dual monitor setup.

10195,"@Defining Slawek the display on the 16� is amazing. I don�t know how the M1 Pro and M2 compare, I�d assume M1 Pro is still significantly better, but I�d say the main advantage to the 14� would be the display and speakers. However, I think it�s only slightly thinner than my 16� which is already pretty chunky. This is really weird but if you get the 14�, prepare for your computer to be fat shamed. 
The silver, the black keyboard, and the black screen when off look really nice together. The silver also makes the computer feel smaller. My friend has the space gray version and it just feels like it takes up more space even though it doesn�t.,1,Michael,2022-06-09T16:04:31Z,1,,0.6472222222222223,0.1347222222222222;;"

10235,"Straight up I think Apple just bungled product release. 

I was expecting the MacBook Air to debut with the same colors as the M1 iMac lineup from last spring. And for the MacBook Pro to look like the lineup we�re getting with the M2 MacBook Air. Such a variety falls in line with the same color scheme Apple releases with the iPhone and iPhone pros. 

I think this has a lot to do with the supply chain issues that have been affecting the whole industry. Apple which has been able to stay ahead is now In the same boat as its competitors. Because Apple always feels the need to have to release something eye-catching during the developer conference, I think they prematurely released this line Under pressure To get new products out to market to maintain its profit margins.,1,Brian Castro,2022-06-09T02:06:16Z,0,1.0,0.3134680134680134,0.1151515151515151;;"

If you're a developer xcode is 40gb
MacOS itself is 40gb installed

If you're a photographer or video editor then you're probably working off a dongle because your files are on a card. Raw photos are 40mb and if you shot 2000 photos that's 80gb. And 1 hour 4k video is 3 gb. So say you're doing all of that, that's ~160gb.

10483,ipads are still limited and not a complete laptop replacement yet
10484,Totally agree that the M2 MacBook Air is a better overall package than the M2 MacBook Pro 13 this time around.  Apple clearly was not ready to overhaul the MacBook Pro 13 body as it would have at least received the MagSafe port. The only change was the chip and that did not require a body change.   M2 MacBook Air was the priority

10564,Debating if I should get the M2 Air
10565,Midnight please.!
10566,I�m curious why you like a dedicated function bar instead of the Touch Bar. Can you share any thoughts on that? I�ve always found the Touch Bar to be pretty sweet. Not sure what I�m missing.
10567,Fingerprints overload on the Midnight Air. That's what I assumed
10568,Starlight gets my vote. Also I�m going to wait for them to update the whole pro line ro M2 then consider updating. Dont really have an issue with Midnight personally.
10569,I'm wedged I'm Between the Silver or the starlight maybe even the space grey but i already have a space grey air so want something new hence either the starlight or the silver
10570,"I'm waiting until I can see it in real life. I remember hearing from someone that the watch in starlight could look a bit weird under most lighting conditions, but from the photos it looks beautiful.

10590,I�m here in the comments because of the sensor dust
10591,the M2 pro announcement also bugged the hell out of me. I would have been less annoyed if they just killed that model.
10592,Sorry MKBHD. 1199$ is the new 999$ in terms of inflation. I�m surprised apple isn�t charging more honestly considering all the inflation.
10593,The design is not better. It's got a notch come on. Agreed its not a major issue but it means the design is worse.
10594,I am just happy that the Touch Bar still lives on. I guess I�m not the only person that likes it
10595,Your audio quality annoys me
10596,That�s VERY blue
10597,I would just wait for Black Friday and get the M1 hah
10598,Black??
10599,I saw a side by side comparison between the air and pro 13 and it actually looked almost similar in real life. Well if you go �budget� at their base pro 13 has that 2 more GPU. I guess I wouldn�t jump the gun but just wait for more real word reviews and comparisons after a month later.
10600,you need to clean your camera lens lol
10601,Personally
10602,@anindita basak Whatever the model would be called
10603,If Apple made a 15 inch MacBook Air they should make it so thin that it is just as light as the current M2 MacBook Air or even lighter. Most people love the light weight of Air

10609,That notch is a dealbreaker for me personally� makes no sense on a laptop for the user
10610,@D K it�s not even noticeable though but still gets brought up more than the outstanding performance of Apple over its competition� so silly ??
10611,@TheGlenGarrys i said personally dont like that aesthetic. It looks gaudy. If you like it
10612,Oh shut up about the notch already .. like it matters to anyone other than Apple haters hanging on to something to hate on ??????
10613,HATE the notch. That's already enough of a reason to not buy this. Price increase just makes it easier to not want it.
10614,Why still no touchscreen. And get rid of that notch. Touch ID works fine. Will stick with XPS 13.
10615,Apple should have ditched that 13in Macbook Pro.  It is not a worthy upgrade at all and feels out of place in the lineup and there is the 14in Macbook Pro which is a lot better in terms of performance (albeit more expensive of course).  The fans and larger battery bank dont make a significant difference because the M1 Macbook Air was just as good as the M1 Macbook Pro even way back in 2020 in real world usage.
10616,Im pretty sure this video was edited on that new macbook air
10617,For a guy who a naked phone. Midnight it is!
10618,Seems like a good trick to get people buying the new MacBook Air for a �deal� while they revamp the pro
10619,Space Grey might be the option still
10620,"Do the midnight blue for your test. We already know what Silver and Grey and gold looks like why duplicate efforts. Also it would be helpful to me at least to see how photo editing such as layering and somewhat intensive or ram heavy workloads compare to the macbook pro 14"". I am looking at 16gb ram and 512gb hd with baseline chip for either air or the pro 14"" which with those specs would be the baseline pro. Not sure if the $400 is worth it or if the air can handle photo editing with Adobe elements or some mid tier editing software or will it be painful and just go with the pro or is pro only be marginally better than the air at those specs....,0,Glenn Ellis,2022-06-09T00:57:52Z,6,0.0,0.4535353535353535,-0.0636363636363636;;"

I see no reason to pick up the Pro 13 over the new Air or Pro 14. I guess you would only get it if you absolutely cannot stand having a notch on your laptop.

I also have the M1 Ultra 16 inch MacBook Pro and dislike the thickness and sharp front edge on my hands and wrists. It�s still some of that classic Apple form over function poor choices left over from the Jobs era. How hard would it be to radius the front edge in their machining process?
10817,I actually like the TouchBar. Would be really nice if Apple did a full row of function keys
10818,I enjoy the Touch Bar as well! Was so sad when they took it away from the newest Pro Model Mac books :(

My interpretation is that Apple seems to be using the baseline M2 MacBook Pro as a decoy to push people towards either end of the spectrum. People who want the convenience for a bargain will be pushed to buy the M2Air for slightly cheaper, which will likely provide higher higher margins than the pro for Apple. People who really seek performance are likely to go M1Pro or Ultra (maybe M2 pro or ultra when/if that is unveiled) which moves customers up the pricing ladder.

While I do use FCP and Motion every once and a while for motion graphics or prototyping, it�s not often and it�s handled those situations very well. 

I was thinking about getting the new Pro when it was first announce but I might just go with the M2 Air and bump the memory up to 24GB on the baseline since I don�t use more than about 150GB of storage at most times.,1,Justin Latham,2022-06-08T23:29:25Z,0,0.0,0.4370240870240869,0.4171328671328671;;"

11072,"I had the exact same thought while watching the keynote about the M2 MB pro. Seems like an insanely niche audience. Weird they didn�t update the design of it either. From what I can tell, it�s the only �recent� MacBook with the older design and what not.

They should have updated the bezels, added M2 with active cooling, MagSafe, and a 1080p camera. Then it would be a reasonable upgrade. But for me, with its current specs, design, and appearance, it�s not even a consideration. I would either do the M2 air for $1200 or the 14� MB Pro with M1 Pro for $2k. 
The M2 MB pro just seems like it�s in limbo� like if it was a 2 year old device already that just needed the updated design and such, that�s what it seems like; but it�s �brand new��
Very, very odd of Apple. 

I think it�s time for a CEO change. Bring in someone younger, that wants to release feature packed software/hardware, that wants to make �pro� devices pro, give us some extra pro software to go along with our �pro� hardware. Listen to your customer base on features that we�ve been begging for for years and years.

+ My other thought is that Apple currently has as wide portfolio of premium laptops as it can ever have. There is almost no price gap between each models whatsoever, it only depends on if you're willing to spend an additional $100 for higher-end model or if you're good with bigger RAM or storage at the same model.

I am getting a new macbook air because my 2015 Pro is done for though I love it but it would be nice to handle a faster machine with a battery that is not swelling. I would totally go for a Pro but the prices are crazy and in the end I am not a professional who will ever need that much performance. I would just get a mac mini if I needed too.

11333,"How To Go To Heaven
������It is very simple to be saved and takes only a minute to explain.�Please let me show you how to get�to�Heaven�from the Bible, God's Word...

Man is a�Sinner�in the Eyes of a Holy God.

Isaiah 53:6, �All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.�Romans 3:19, �Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the�world may become guilty before God.�John 3:3, �Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.�Romans 3:10, �As it is written,�There is none righteous, no, not one.�Romans 3:23, �For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.�

There�is a Price For Our Sin?Burning in Hell Forever.��

Romans 6:23, �For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.�Romans 5:12, �Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and�death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.�2nd Thessalonians 1:8, �In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.�Revelation 20:15, ""And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was�cast into the lake of fire.�Revelation 21:8, �But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in�the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.�

Jesus paid that price�by dying�on�the cross�and shedding His blood; Christ was buried and bodily rose again the third day!

Romans 5:8, �But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,�Christ died for us.�John 3:16, �For God so loved the world, that�he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.�1st Timothy 1:15, �This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that�Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.�1st Peter 1:18-19, �Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not�redeemed�with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;�But with the precious blood of Christ...�1st Corinthians 15:1-4,��Moreover, brethren,�I declare unto you�the gospel�which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that�Christ died�for our sins according to the scriptures; And that�he was buried, and that�he rose again the third day�according to the scriptures.� This is the Gospel.

By faith in Jesus Christ�ALONE�we�are immediately�saved.Galatians 3:26, �For ye are all the children of God�by faith in Christ Jesus.�John 11:25, �Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life:�he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.�John 6:28-29, �Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them,�This is the work of God, that ye believe on him�whom he hath sent.�Ephesians 2:8-9, �For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.�John 14:6, �Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father,�but by me.�John 6:40, �And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son,�and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.�Mark 1:15, �And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand:�repent ye, and believe the gospel.�Acts 26:18, �To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified�by faith that is in me.�Romans 10:13, �For whosoever shall call upon the�name of the Lord�shall be saved.�1st Corinthians 3:11, ""For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid,�which is Jesus Christ.�Galatians 3:26, �For ye are all the children of God�by faith in Christ Jesus.�

Salvation is NOT found in a religion or good works, but in a�Person...�The LORD JESUS CHRIST!

11380,"I'll admit, as a programmer, I kind of miss the Touch Bar after moving to a 14"" MBP from an older Touch Bar 15"" MBP. I know, programmers usually are known to hate the Touch Bar, but there were a lot of unique functionality that are hard to find on non-Touch Bar MacBooks. I liked that when you are debugging code in Xcode, it allows you to pause/set breakpoints/etc without it in focus. The screenshot taking button on Touch Bar is excellent and much better than memorizing hotkeys. And the spelling completion on the Touch Bar makes typing emojis much more seamless than having to do Cmd-Ctrl-Space on a regular keyboard. Some programming apps also have custom support for Touch Bar as well so you can add buttons to do the things you want. Oh well, I think the boat has sailed.

On the pricing front for M2, it's important to note that the M2 MacBook Air isn't really cheaper than the MacBook Pro if you upgrade SSD / RAM to the same spec. It still puts the 13"" MacBook Pro at a really weird spot though, as pointed out.,1,BrotherCheng,2022-06-08T22:19:57Z,1,1.0,0.5766826923076922,0.1625;;"

11433,"Personally I'm not too fond of the new MacBook designs, the reason being that they feel very 90's esque, while that wave has come and went, it just seems as a way to do something unexpected, which imo is a huge Stepdown from previous generations innovative ideas. 

It is though interesting seeing apple switching from Jonathan Ives clean minimalist, durable and timeless designs over to computers which are more ""in"" or ""out"" and feels almost retro, which means that in a couple of years people are gonna be thinking macbooks of today look out of style because they are too in style with the trends of 2022 or imo the last couple of years. To me it seems as yet another weapon to nodge consumers to buy products more frequently, because they lost consumers on the right to repair loss.

I have been watching what Apple has been doing the last 10 years with a keen eye, and have been full of joy each time they kept on innovating. To me the peak has to be the release of the M1 Mac, where they simplified the computer down to 2 usbc ports, as well as iPhones getting simplified down to a wireless charger and complete minimalism. 

To me this seems like a huge step in the wrong direction of cables and clutter. The next few years we are probably gonna see a teardown of what I've has built over the last 10 years, in an attempt to create ""tech fashion"" where technology will get replaced like fashion every few seasons, not because of necessity, but because of greed by Apple. 

This comment has gotten very out of hand, and I just wanted to say that I didn't like the comparison between the two computers, beacuase it is very subjective.

11567,"Concerning the pricing and how Europeans (such as myself) are complaining about the price increases and many Americans telling us that we are forgetting about VAT not being included.

I posted this as a reply on a comment before but I would like to add it for everyone to see:


German here, let's do a quick calculation for everybody saying that we forget about VAT not being included.

MacBook Air M1 is 1199�: $999 + highest sales tax in the US (Tennessee 9.55%) = $1094,4045 which is 1.018,67� so 180.33�/ $193,74 cheaper.

Both can be bought cheaper if not bought directly from Apple but I chose consistent Apple pricing.

MacBook Air M2 is 1499�: $1199 + highest sales tax in the US (Tennessee 9.55%) = $1313,5045 which is 1.222,61� so 276,39�/ $296,94 cheaper.

The argument of forgetting about added VAT is totally invalid because it is still going to be way cheaper in the end. The least of you (which I think is a fair assumption to make) live in Tennessee, which has the absolute highest VAT. Even your highest VAT is almost exactly half of what German VAT is (19%).,1,pennerman,2022-06-08T22:00:37Z,0,0.0,0.4435897435897437,0.1348484848484848;;"

The only modification is pulling off the factory thermal pad and putting on a thicker one that connects the processor directly to the chassis as a giant heatsink. You could save the pad and put it back if you wanted to. Only downside is that the bottom of the case directly under the cpu can get pretty hot (40C+) which could burn you if you leave it on your lap for a long time. I work on a desk/table most of the time and its raised on its rubber feet so I don't have an issue with the heat.

11853,"@Evsual ""because they've made the laptop itself significantly faster"" ...  Significantly faster? No they did not. This is a 2 year product cycle update, as people seem to forget that the M1 came out in 2020. Your getting 18% faster MT, what is mostly located on the E-Cores ( in other words, you do not feel any faster response there ). that increased 40% performance but those E-Cores are so dog slow from the start, even with 40% they are nowhere near useable for primary tasks. That leave you with the 4 Performance cores. The P-Cores are about 10% faster. Notice how Apple again mixes the marketing to fool people. 

The GPU has a 37% upgrade ( with a increased in power usage. Where its only a 25% if you want the same TDP). Given you have no fan, what do you think happens to a GPU that needs more power? Yep, it thermal throttles faster and that 37% will never be 37%. You need the Pro with the fan to get that benefit!

If we compare that to AMD 4800U to 6800U. They did a 28% faster ST, 46% faster MT, 115% faster GPU in that same timeframe. And they did not upgrade the OEM prices for those CPUs, while 16GB / 1TB has become a standard (aka free included ) feature on most laptops.

I am amazed at how little people understand of hardware and how easy they can be fooled to believe some marketing BS. O, M1 Max encodes as fast as a 3090. That means a M1 Max is as fast as a 3090 at gaming, right ( notice how Apple never answers those question and lets it up to the hype)? O, wait, it only performs as fast as a 1200 Euro laptop's 3050~3060 ranged with actual games because its 3060 like hardware with a great media encoder. Its easy to fool people when they do not do research and 90% of the youtubers constantly post only the good parts that Apple want them to focus on ( i wonder why? Might have something to do with Access to Apple and hardware? ;-0 ),1,Ben Jiro,2022-06-09T12:38:48Z,2,,0.5652116402116403,0.2190696649029982;;"

11855,@User I agree - this probably should be the base MBP lol. The whole point of the MBA is that it has been the 'default laptop' for most people for a long time (though recent years with quality control issues and crappy keyboard less so

11883,@Evsual If it was $200 here in Australia I'd agree with you. But here the price hike is $400. Faster performance and better screen is not going to be hugely noticeable for most Air users. And bringing back magsafe like it's a new feature is hardly a plus lol.
11884,Agree.  The m1 MacBook Air as apples baseline laptop starting at 1000 was already expensive
11885,@Nic_CCC I think it's worth it because they've made the laptop itself significantly faster
11886,100% agreed. I'd rather save and invest in the Pro 14-inch one tbh.
11887,@Omar Chaudhry well that�s a good point but I�ll still justify the price as it�s one of the thinnest laptops in its class.. if only the screen could better

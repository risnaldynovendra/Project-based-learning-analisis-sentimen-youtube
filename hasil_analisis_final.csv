I myself actually do not have a MacBook and am now considering buying one. For me the MacBook Air M2 visually very chic especially in the dark color. What�s also very charming is the MacBook is very light in weight and has no active cooling. So it is completely silent. However, I don't know how the performance would be without active cooling if I were to take part in a meeting with the camera activated via teams or use Final Cut from time to time....

If I hadn't seen some comparison videos now, I would buy MacBook Air M2 in the midnight color and additionally selected the larger GPU (10-core) incl. 16 GB RAM and 1 terabyte SSD. That would put the price at 2309 EUR. But now some say that you can directly get the MacBook Pro 14 inch, because I it costs 170 EUR more I guess and has more power and active cooling.
Now I am undecided ??.
I would use the MacBook privately and sometimes for work: Surfing, do office work (Word, Excel or even sometimes participate in meetings via teams) very rarely edit music or edit the one or other video with Final Cut.
I think the MacBook Air M2 with my configuration is enough, right?,1,Ali,2022-06-15T17:44:36Z,0,0.0,0.6043506493506494,0.1673051948051948;;",2022-03-21T22:54:44Z,20,4

412,"Great review - I agree the design refresh is sick & the new Macs are very promising. Im glad they brought back the magnetic charging, I dont entirely understand why they removed it to begin with. Interesting that the laptop body picks up fingerprints so easily. I'd assume Apple would have picked that up during development, but no one is perfect.

Disappointing that Apple didnt redesign the Mac Pro M2. I was interested in buying one for school work, currently I use a refurbed Dell laptop running RHEL. I would love to have a Mac to run MS applications & have a UNIX based OS, but I'm not interested in the lack of redesign for the M2 Pro.

The M2 seems like an intermediate CPU update. I assume Apple has something bigger up their sleeve or are maybe holding off on big changes due to supply or manufacture problems.,1,Noah Whalen,2022-06-13T04:52:19Z,0,0.0,0.5747234247234246,0.1564117364117364;;",2022-03-11T05:17:04Z,13,3

In your experience which Mac you would recommend for music production?Brief introduction I'm a pianist and I use Logic for creating music for Movies and my personal projects and  I don't know between the new one what to get as Home Studio not portable one. So I'm undecided to get  either the 2021 I Mac or the Mac Studio. Probably the Mac Studio as I'm using lots of VST and about 100 tracks with Automation  but wanted to know your opinion about that. Thanks in advance :) Maybe there will be new Mac Pro M1 coming up? Hard to say... I don't wanna buy and regret to not have waited just a little bit longer hahah,2022-03-11T02:18:38Z,6,7

Back then, I needed portability due to the way the tech world was with office work and client visits. in 2020 we had the pandemic, and the world changed where we could work remotely, in fact it was encouraged. All of a sudden I could comfortably get by with having desktop. I then sold my 2015 Intel Macbook pro for 500 to a DJ. I bought an M1 Mac Mini for 550 and a used like new 32 inch AOC 4k monitor for 350. I had vouchers from work on Amazon as a bonus and used that to buy a Keychron keyboard, a Logitech MX Master and a Dprofy soundbar.

You can enter the app, but you can also reply in the notification. Like.... WTF???? I want things central and not spread out in multiple levels. But that bar is nothing, compared to flat design. It is like MS and Apple said ""fuck it, we use it so heavy that people dont know what is a function/feature anymore"". And I hate that aproach the industry have taken to heart. Like in Win10, in settings, it took me 30 minute to figure out that a line of text were like a button or something. When things are that heavily used, it is bad for the user experience.

IMHO  moving to the M2 in the MB 13in Pro was a no brainer plus its would be strange if the Pro was less powerful than the Air and could do less stuff.Who would buy the 13in Pro??? Perhaps Apple had to guarantee its developers that the touchbar would remain for likely Pro Apps until its dropped from them all. So it had to still sell the smaller/""lighter"" 13in MBP. Looking at the specs, I can see the 13in MBP being dropped first as the top end Air has the same specs (if not better and lighter). What customer needs a 10GPU M2 Macbook Air with a 2TB SSD/24GB RAM?

1444,"It's a little frustrating to me that people have these assumptions that all creative professionals will automatically buy the more expensive M1 Pro or M1 Max models and therefore there's no value on the M2 13 inch MacBook Pro update. There are plenty of photographers and others like me who are interested in finding the best performance and user experience at the most cost effective level, especially if it's required for your business to be efficient and profitable. The $500+ plus difference between the M2 13"" MBP and the M1 Pro 14"" MBP is a considerable chunk of change for a self employed photographer, which could be better spent on lenses or other gear. I'm not saying I wouldn't love an M1 Pro or Max laptop, but I wouldn't discredit the M2 MBP entirely for those who need sustained performance at the lowest price.

That said, I do think the M2 Air is the more intriguing machine now, although I find it hard to justify the price increase given the measly 8GB of memory and 256GB storage.

And my opinion is strongly the second, as Apple wasn't so diffused a few years back... - same goes within its lineup. _MOST_ people who buy the Pro is because they want the pro/serious image, and those buy the Air want to have the more air/traveller image.... the price is not really a problem, 1400 or 1600 doesn't really make a difference, does it?

Mine still works great however 2 years ago the entire logic board and battery had to be replaced. It was $970 to repair and because of an Apple repair bulletin which mine qualified for,2022-03-08T18:28:49Z,16,3
1859,"I also have late 2016 MB Pro and it's been a disaster since I got it. But after updates it's gotten even worse; external SSD's stopped working, my professional camera stopped working, changes in security settings cause compiling errors on my game project, battery lasts 1 hour max in Lightroom despite 85% battery health, keys breaking, bugs in the OS, etc.

I guess I was unlucky with mine if yours works still? Regardless, I switched to Surface Pro 8 recently and damn, this thing feels so much more premium and futuristic. Gone is the flimsy aluminum that makes a popping sound every time I pick up my MB Pro, I now have a touch screen and great pen for drawing game characters, it's thinner and lighter than even the latest MB Air; it's a tablet, a laptop and a desktop PC � with an ability to use eGPU for monsterous desktop performance. The versatility is just INSANE!

The first is the 'decoy pricing' many ppl have stated. The second I think is because the Apple silicon refresh cycle is a bit messy - because the M1 Pro and Ultra came out a whole year after the M1, what they need to say now is that the M2 is better than a chip from 2 yrs ago but *not* better than last year's chip...which is weird.
Plus having two ""Pro"" laptops with almost the same size (14"" vs 13.6"") makes no sense so I'm guessing they will align this to the M2 Pro next year or kill off the line.,1,Abdul Rahman Noor,2022-06-09T12:54:28Z,0,0.0,0.3687500000000001,0.0083333333333333;;",2022-03-08T18:10:27Z,13,5

I find this funny that they always try to create line between an everyday user and a professional user instead of saying �essentially we were using less or equally powerful laptop as MBA m1/m2 to make these reviews, so yeah you can use it professionally�
Basically no matter how much they try most of them cannot get into the shoe of an avg user with tight budget who is working professionally and thriving financially using m1 base laptop which these reviewers deem to be for web browsing and not for so called YT professionals.
I guess thats cz they never had to squeeze the so called base model as they always have access to the latest models and subconsciously they are satisfying their own purchase of the m1 pro laptops although even they dont need m1pro to edit a 4k 10min review.

TBH even these big YTers also get into the trap of capitalism & consumerism and become the victims of marketing and not using and consider these machines as tools to solve problems and persuade their viewers into the same trap.,1,Balram Sharan,2022-06-09T10:41:59Z,0,0.0,0.4871252204585538,0.0214726631393298;;",2022-03-08T18:07:46Z,9,6

2356,The real question about the lineup is where the iPad air really fits in. If it can be placed properly in the Airline of products things make better sense in terms of the air serving nonpros as a continuous spectrum of products leading to the pro line with the Mac studio and the MacBook pro being the next steps up. The iPad Air actually sits between the M1 MacBook  Air and the M2 MacBook Air. This gives you air features and laptop capabilities depending on your use case. But I really think the iPad gets paired as a second device to whichever laptop you have not as a standalone unit unto itself. This is why running macOS on it makes no sense. If you want to run Pro Apps then get an M2 MacBook and keep the iPad for review and approvals or for prototyping and concept generation and content consumption. If you have an M1 then it is the carry-around on-the-go solution when you don't create or need a lot of typing.  It's too expensive when you add a pen and a keyboard to it compared to a laptop so don't make it one.,2022-03-08T17:41:25Z,14,8

2383,"@Ville Siltala I agree this will be good for lots of people. The reason I say 2 ports is not enough is that both my interface and keyboard say they need direct connection, not a dock, but maybe that is the manufacturer being paranoid.

My main point is that an extra 2 ports would cost apple very little to implement, but they haven't done it, presumably to drive people to the Pro line. Same with the single display limit.

2384,"@Robert Hunt for that use case you described here, Air is not the best option. For many other use cases for musicians, it is. Many of Apple users already have dongles purchased so there's no extra cost for getting some extra ports if needed. And I'm really not buying that latency argument, if you route your audio interface through a dongle or a dock. Any data on that?

The reason to buy an Air is definitely portability. If you move around a lot e.g., you're a dj, Air could be the perfect solution for you. In your case, it might not.

It baffles me people don't understand that there are lots of different use cases people have and I was pointing out musician requiring a portable solution with enough spec to run music production software. For that use case, Air is a great option for many. Not for all, but for many. Even if a product is not for you, it doesn't mean, there is no market for it.,1,Ville Siltala,2022-06-14T07:49:40Z,1,,0.4741666666666667,0.2841666666666667;;",2022-03-08T17:39:30Z,12,3

No one needs the high impedance headphone input. Either use wireless headphones or earbuds or get a good DAC interface and plug in via its 1/4� hi-Z jack (instead of the standard 1/8�) plus have good outputs for quality studio monitors/better speakers and higher quality input options for mics for music recording, podcast, live-streaming, etc.

I�m just really fucking annoyed that Apple didn�t fix the single external  monitor issue, and to a lesser extent that they didn�t just put the new USB-C input on the other side.

2541,"Marques, I think you forgot that the 13"" macbook pro is still the best selling macbook pro by a huge margin. That is why they are limited on changing it too much. For now I assume. There is a huge segment of the market that hates the new design still. Chances are they have manufacturing contracts to fullfill with the older design still and back-log on manufacturing with that design especially with their rapid switch to cutting off intel. Apple is really dropping the ball in making the air without a 15"" option and moving pro to 15"" default and 17"" or more for higher end models. 13"" in 2022 feels super small really. These screens aren't much different than the largest ipad pro screen size and the ipad pro's honestly have a better looking screen without any doubt. Prices went up realistically due to the cost of manufacturing right now. Inflation is really bad. I work for a tech/power company (huge in every industry) and people cannot even fathom just how bad the supply chain and costs all around are. IT'S REALLY BAD.

It's a new thing and also, I kinda have a different take on fingerprint smudges, scratches and dents: These are battle scars and make the device more ""yours"". They show that it's been loved and used with so much passion and has been through adventures and mishaps. They are more like memories etched on the device. My current laptop has a ton of scratches, dents and smudges, but each one tells a story and I wouldn't have my laptop any other way.

They are as unique as fingerprints. Each set of smudges, scratches and dents represents a unique personality and a unique story of friendship and partnership between the device and the user.

If you believe in this take, please always go for the colors you like and never think of the physical deformities that may be more evident due to that particular color.,1,Harshit Doshi,2022-06-09T06:18:55Z,0,0.0,0.5269209956709958,0.2392518939393939;;",2022-03-08T17:29:37Z,11,8

I�m sure this is the last Macbook Pro in the old design and whoever gets it now knows that. I mean they made a chip transition and an aesthetic transition. For some that�s too much at once and they need a bit more time. Also the old macbook pro seems to be very popular even with the new models out cause of the price.

It sounds like a great deal on paper, but if you have an M1 Air (like I do), I don't really see much of a reason to upgrade, here are a few things they could have done to sweeten the deal a little bit:
- Quantum Dot LED
- ProMotion Display for better battery life
- Touchscreen
- Face ID
- One thunderbolt port on each side instead of both on one side
- A single USB-A port
- Start at 16GB RAM for the same price

2824,"Apple employee here! adding M2 chip to the mac book pro was unexpected for us. 
That was the las minute decision taken by the management team without informing the software team. Basically, hardware team is so confident that m1 chips can be easily replaced with M2 and that needs no additional testing. So there is no prototype for a MacBook pro with M2 yet. This decision was take to sell all the old hardware that was stock piled.

The plan for the cips are as follows
M2 - iPad pro, iPad air, Mac book Air, Mac mini
M2 pro - Mac book pro -14 & 16, iMac, Mac Studio
M2 max - Mac book pro -14 & 16, iMac, Mac Studio, Mac Pro
M2 ultra - iMac, Mac Studio, Mac Pro (focused mainly on gaming and content creation)

2855,"Seems that comments about excessive pricing do not account for the cost issues facing every manufacturer of most any worthy item these days. Component shortages translate into manufacturing cost increases, compounded on top of the more generalized price increases we are all experiencing to an astonishing degree.  Apple's shift from prior anticipated pricing norms reflects the reality of running a successful business in these current poorly managed economic conditions.
As a consumer, an approach to coping with the problem is to future-proof purchases with upgrades that are likely to extend useful life.  So the M2 MB Air I order will likely be quite more expensive than the base, but yet a trivial price in my view since squeezing 13 years out of the trusty magsafe 5-pound aluminum tricked-out MBP with which I am composing this comment (yet destined, finally, to be retired by that worthy alternative)...its age a clear reflection of my own.

2956,"To me eyes, keeping the macbook pro 13� in the actual lineup is just part of neuromarketing strategy such as anchor pricing.  Let me explain futher:  

-So when we see this laptop still on sale we think �what an old fashioned and boring design� and it is even expensier than the All new Macbook Air, what?-same processor?! really!? hmm�. �. The next thing we would do is turn our sight back to the Macbook Air with its slick design & sexy midnight black color�MagSafe� a modern notch!(xD) and so on�easy piece! Buy the Air!. This way we momentarily forget that Apple raised its price tag tremendously with a 20% and/or we could say that it is worth it.   For anyone who still complains� well that is why they keep selling the M1 Air.   

I could be wrong of course, but If someone knows how to sell products and make good profit out of it, that is Apple. Hands down. And yeah they just mentioned it in the presentation, the Macbook Air is the MOST popular Apple laptop (If I remember right�), so do the math$$$. I mean is also a good product.

In Macos Everything related to the applications is stored in the �library� �application support�, you delete the file and that's it.

Surface is very elegant and functional but if I were to buy a tablet it would be an iPad M1 that also has a pen and keyboard and is fast. 

You're also right, PCs work a little better than before, but as I told you, that ""Frankenstein"" factor and constant virus scanning is a big no for me. I still have nightmares about ""ctrl+alt-del"" because Windows gets stuck and never recovers no matter how powerful the PC is. 

I like to be organized and I like Apple's approach to minimalism. Windows look and feel seems stuffy to me.

3073,"@Peter_Shadow As an artist myself, Surface Pro 8 is so much better than Macbooks for me personally; it has touch and pen, makes a lot of difference.

Not sure how long it's been since you used Windows before, but it's come a long way. Everything just works and the hardware (at least in case of Surface) is premium and beautifuf. Windows 11 is quite elegant too, MacOS feels very inconsistent and unfinished to me, it never started making that much sense even after 6 years of using it. 

For instsnce, why is it that CMD + X and CMD + V does work for cutting and pasting EVERYWHERE except Finder? Why do I have to remember a special cutting key combination CMD + Option + C (I think it was?) to do the same thing just there? 

Speaking of crap files, why does MacOS not remove all the files when I remove an application? I have HALF of my SSD filled in this mysterious section called ""Other"" when I look at the storage manager. After a lot of Googling and folder exploring I discovered that I have my Mac littered with old files from old programs that MacOS hasn't bothered to remove despite me uninstalling the software assosiacted with the files long ago. It's impossible to remove all of the files since I have no clue where everything is, what is important and what isn't � this has happened with multiple software and is super annoying.

Then I hate that some apps do not maximize properly. It's inconsistent. Like Lightroom does maximize, but Photoshop doesn't. I guess this has to do with the developers themselves, but in Windows when I press that same button I know exactly what's going to happen. Same goes for the X button, how it works on MacOS is highly inconsistent, some apps minimize for no clear reasoning while some apps close.

Windows has its own share of BS, but MacOS feels like multiple people programming a software and nobody communicating to each other, resulting in a total mess. 

I suppose these are matters of taste, I can understand why people do like Macs. It's an experience all the way from unboxing to using the device. They are well built hardware wise and apparently some people like MacOS (for reasons I'm not understanding).,0,PhazonBlaxor,2022-06-12T14:58:55Z,0,,0.5235849787069299,-0.0184843205574912;;",2022-03-11T18:42:16Z,5,2

It is rare that you have had so many problems since Apple is the Standard system in the art industry. Safari is my preferred browser and as soon as I started using Big Sur, Safari was not the same, but as updates came it got better. Many errors also happen because the applications we use are not ready for a new operating system. In 15+ years using Apple absolutely no problems other than that.

When I worked as a sound engineer I built a PC with the latest on the avenue for that time and I could never work in peace, it crashed, warning windows all the time, anti virus updates among other situations. I bought a basic iMac and my damn problems are over. I sold the PC crap for 1/4 of what it cost me, I just didn't want to hear about it.

I can't stand Windows, they store a lot of crap files and I don't trust that the video card is made in the North Pole with some standards, the processor in the South Pole with other standards and the Motherboard in the Bermuda Triangle with other standards.

3098,"@PhazonBlaxor Ah, nice to see Microsoft built in some touch specific improvements. I really think they need to just come out with a brand new from scratch OS and then do 2-3 years of supporting both Win 11 and Win X before sunsetting Win 11 and using just the new OS from that point on. I know legacy support is important to them, but I think it holds them back a lot, too. Windows 8 I think was an attempt at that, but the backlash scared them into backing off where they were trying to go.

I couldn't draw a stick figure if my life depended on it, so I admit I'm not at all graphically knowledgable, but for touch and pen input wouldn't the iPad Pro be the better interface? I understand not wanting to have two devices if it could be avoided, but I thought Photoshop itself was just released for iPad. Like I imagine your computer interactions would fall into two distinct categories: 1) interacting with the system; 2) doing the drawing/art related stuff. I can't imagine pen + touch being better for interacting with the system itself (sending an email, changing settings, etc), but the actual drawing/creative work itself I'm sure is drastically improved by pen/touch compared to mouse/keyboard. 

Because of this, I think what Apple is doing with Continuity has so much potential. I can be using my Mac to type emails/send invoices; but then ideally I could fire up whatever art program I need to do creative work in and it would automatically activate the iPad so that I could use that touch/pen interface for that purpose. 

But again, I am not a graphic artist at all, so I am admittedly talking from outside the domain (I do software programming and dabble in music, but I suck at art).,1,Tommy Craft,2022-06-09T22:01:59Z,0,,0.4919536271808999,0.3328512396694215;;",2022-03-11T08:25:09Z,19,2
3099,"More likely just want to get rid of spare bodies and components in production, Mainly in chip and component shortage it�s a great choice to do. 

And off course changing the price doesn�t make sense for many reasons - Apple kept the price of the basic 1299 MBP since 2017 when they first released two versions of Macbook pro, it would be strange if they just suddenly shifted from years ahead planned pricing program. Second reason is simply because Air could never be more expensive than Pro because of the naming, that is why Macbook Pro stays even though it sells less it will probably sell enough for it to help with getting rid of spare parts and it is not going to burden the production problems of chips.

And honestly Apple �Wants to build and sell tons of Airs at high margins� is not really the case, the new Air has definitely the lowest margin from any of the 3 low grade computers Apple sells right now. 
The goal is to sell as many M1 Macbook Airs as possible because those are going to be some of the highest margin devices with the time they have been in production and that is the main reason why the new Air is 1199� to make the older one seem like a great deal and at the same time boosting margins in creation of a new device Apple has done the same thing in 2018 with the release of the first retina Macbook Air.

3100,"@Tommy Craft Windows 11 has larger hitboxes around everything so it's easier to touch things. The operating system itself is well optimized for touch now even without tablet mode (it makes much more sense that there is no separate tablet mode, IMO), I rarely use the device with keyboard and pen if I'm not docked � it's actually enjoyable as a tablet, and I've used a bunch of iPads and Android tablets in the past.

But app support for touch is still kinda meh. Many of the pro software I've used work weird with touch � photoshop is an exception, they actually have gestures for things like undo, which is super handy.

And I can see why you would think touch is pointless, but as a graphic designer touch + pen is a must-have feature compared to trackpad or mouse. 

Besides, wouldn't you as a consumer rather have one device that can do it all well, instead of having to buy and carry multiple devices? That's what I've loved about SP8, it replaced my MB Pro, my Android tablet, my desktop and my Wacom drawing tablet all in one strike. It's just convenient that I don't need to transfer files between devices anymore, and I got SP8 basically for free after I sold all the things it replaced.

Apple is so far behind with MacOS, it's been a terrible user experience. Lacking a touch screen is also a huge minus for me as a photographer and graphics designer. SP8 is both slimmer and lighter than MB Air, it can function as a tablet, as a laptop and as a desktop PC. Apple isn't offering this kind of versatility at all, M1 and M2 chips are awesome for sure, but when I compare these two ultraportable computers I can't help but feel that Macbooks are kinda outdated in form and functionality.

And before you attack by the common ""Intel chips are trash"" I will say: YES! Apple silicon is better. But SP8 can handle EVERYTHING I've throw at it despite that and it offers options that Apple isn't offering. I've even tried pushing it and playing some older AAA-games. Games like MGS V runs FHD 60fps no problem for instance � kinda crazy for a computer that is even slimmer and lighter than MB Air.,1,PhazonBlaxor,2022-06-09T14:36:07Z,6,,0.6423976608187134,0.1048245614035087;;",2022-03-10T21:38:56Z,16,6

For example- $999 is ?77k actual conversion. But on apple India site it sells for ?99k ($1287). Similar with other products.

Now i would love to have 512gb / 16gb, which is base for the 14"" mbp, but this bumps the price of the air to 1960�, which is basically 40� difference to the mbp, bcs that one got cheaper buying from other shops than apple.

Now the air does not even have the nice screen of the mbp, which is one of the main reasons i am even considering an apple laptop for the first time ever, the other reason being the m1.

3292,"Apple most likely makes more money of a $1499 Air than a $1499 Pro. One of the Pros, on his list was size/weight. The Air being smaller takes less aluminum to build and that would cut the cost. The Air also has a smaller or not as high quality battery, the higher quality or more quantity of lithium would cause the Pro to cost more to make. The cost of fans, this is probably a not as costly, but is some what costly, and also is a contributor to needing a bigger laptop which goes back to more aluminum. Marques said that he up graded the Air to make them the same price, in reality; Apple offers a version of the M2 Air for $1499 (M2 8core CPU, 10core GPU, 8gb Unified Memory (Ram), 512gb SSD storage). The M2 Pro also has an option for $1499 (M2 8core CPU, 10core GPU, 8gb Unified Memory (Ram), 512gb SSD storage). These are the exact same stats almost. The fans are going to allow better performance continually. Also the Marques has the ports as better on the M2 Air, they actually have the exact same ports, except the M2 Pro has not mag port. Also you are not getting more screen, the expansion from 13.3 to 13.6 is true but you will have a line at the top due to the cameras and sensor bar stuck in the middle. Do you really need a 1080p webcam? Do you like the Touch Bar? These are question you have to ask yourself. I can tell you that the M2 Pro is a better deal if you do light video editing or creating, you might want 16gb ram though, but you would need that upgrade on both making them the same price. Creators are not using a webcam either or the mics; although, the mics on the M2 Pro are better, they are 3 studio quality mics, the Air's 3 mics are not studio quality, or Apple would list it as such. Also the M2 Air has 4 speakers system, but the M2 Pro has Stereo Speakers with High Dynamic Rang, this is not in the description of the M2 Air. A lot of creators also like the Touch Bar, that is a personal preference. For the Money, M2 Pro is a better though.,1,Rory Russell,2022-06-11T08:20:00Z,0,,0.3821171171171171,0.2115765765765766;;",2022-03-09T23:08:40Z,17,7

3330,"@Adam Frank Agree with this totally.  This is my thinking.  By the time you've looked at perhaps 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage, neither of which are outlandish specs, you're getting pretty close to the 14"" in price which unless you're desperate for an incredibly lightweight machine is a far more capable machine than a specced out Air.  Better processor, no throttling, better, bigger display etc.  Also likely to stay fast for longer and be worth far more for resale.  TBH, I don't stretch my 14"" but I still feel it was probably the right choice long term to swallow hard and pay the money.

3582,I'm more excited to see a comparison between M1 pro base model and new M2 Mac Air with 16 gigs unified memory and same external memory of 512 gigs. It would boil down to comparing their performance + what it has to offer port wise. Someone who might have GPU intensive tasks ...

3584,"And it has a better contrast, OLED like, miniLED screen, adaptive 120hz refresh rate, HDMI and SD card slots, 3 USB-C with dual sided charging, thinner bezels, slightly larger screen, likely better performance and beefier GPU, 2 fans for active cooling and the ability to run a dual monitor setup.

3657,I�m honestly more curious about the durability of the finish on the midnight model. And I feel it would look nicer with a skin since it would look less too tone that you get with space grey with a black skin. That being said space grey has always been my go too for Apple devices for a long time so I�m a bit torn.

However, I think it�s only slightly thinner than my 16� which is already pretty chunky. This is really weird but if you get the 14�, prepare for your computer to be fat shamed. 
The silver, the black keyboard, and the black screen when off look really nice together. The silver also makes the computer feel smaller. My friend has the space gray version and it just feels like it takes up more space even though it doesn�t.,1,Michael,2022-06-09T16:04:31Z,1,,0.6472222222222223,0.1347222222222222;;",2022-03-09T05:21:53Z,15,2

3707,"Straight up I think Apple just bungled product release. 

I was expecting the MacBook Air to debut with the same colors as the M1 iMac lineup from last spring. And for the MacBook Pro to look like the lineup we�re getting with the M2 MacBook Air. Such a variety falls in line with the same color scheme Apple releases with the iPhone and iPhone pros. 

I think this has a lot to do with the supply chain issues that have been affecting the whole industry. Apple which has been able to stay ahead is now In the same boat as its competitors. Because Apple always feels the need to have to release something eye-catching during the developer conference, I think they prematurely released this line Under pressure To get new products out to market to maintain its profit margins.,1,Brian Castro,2022-06-09T02:06:16Z,0,1.0,0.3134680134680134,0.1151515151515151;;",2022-03-09T05:14:00Z,9,7

3890,"I can't figure out what the sweet spot configuration for this device is. I feel that if you're going to beef up the specs you should opt for an m1 pro. I'd assume that the 10 core, 16gb memory, and 1tb storage would be the best all around configuration for most people.

If you're a developer xcode is 40gb
MacOS itself is 40gb installed

If you're a photographer or video editor then you're probably working off a dongle because your files are on a card. Raw photos are 40mb and if you shot 2000 photos that's 80gb. And 1 hour 4k video is 3 gb. So say you're doing all of that, that's ~160gb.
I heard that the 1tb drive has faster speeds than the 512gb.

If when people were reviewing the m1 pro and were saying that 16gb ram is enough then 16gb ram is enough here.,1,kayseeday,2022-06-09T01:30:38Z,0,1.0,0.4852564102564102,0.2698717948717948;;",2022-03-09T00:30:29Z,6,2

3986,"Yeah your comments on the M2 13"" MBP being a hard sell is quite apt, because when you spec it to be more 'Pro,' you might as well just bite the bullet, spend a little more, and get a 14"" M1 Pro MBP. The M2 MBA is far easier to recommend these days, since it�s downsides (no active cooling) are minor compared to its upsides.,1,Evan Robertson,2022-06-09T01:18:26Z,0,1.0,0.6052083333333332,0.1546875;;",2022-03-08T22:30:56Z,9,7

4280,I thought the Macbook Pro 14 inch was supposed to replace the Pro 13 inch so I got really confused when they updated it. It feels strange in the line-up. I see no reason to pick up the Pro 13 over the new Air or Pro 14. I guess you would only get it if you absolutely cannot stand having a notch on your laptop.,2022-03-08T23:37:43Z,10,5

I also have the M1 Ultra 16 inch MacBook Pro and dislike the thickness and sharp front edge on my hands and wrists. It�s still some of that classic Apple form over function poor choices left over from the Jobs era. How hard would it be to radius the front edge in their machining process?,2022-03-08T20:14:28Z,19,8

4412,"Solid upgrade. Bummed to see a price hike but given the current economic environment I�m sure that apple is already swallowing costs and managing how much to pass on to consumers. 

My interpretation is that Apple seems to be using the baseline M2 MacBook Pro as a decoy to push people towards either end of the spectrum. People who want the convenience for a bargain will be pushed to buy the M2Air for slightly cheaper, which will likely provide higher higher margins than the pro for Apple. People who really seek performance are likely to go M1Pro or Ultra (maybe M2 pro or ultra when/if that is unveiled) which moves customers up the pricing ladder.

Apple has a genius marketing team and wouldn�t be against doing something to that affect!,1,Chance Curry,2022-06-08T23:39:09Z,2,0.0,0.4686868686868687,0.1303030303030303;;",2022-03-08T19:04:07Z,8,5

4414,Thanks everyone! Looks like the base model would likely suffice for everything I�m looking for. I still might upgrade that RAM to 16Gb just to have a little buffer for performance.,2022-03-08T19:02:36Z,7,2

�Because we care about the environment, and don�t want to waste all the time and energy it took to make all the old pro parts, we�re gonna upgrade the chip in it to make it a viable machine�

They should also just own up to the fact that they�re doing that and sell those machines for a better deal.

While I do use FCP and Motion every once and a while for motion graphics or prototyping, it�s not often and it�s handled those situations very well. 

I was thinking about getting the new Pro when it was first announce but I might just go with the M2 Air and bump the memory up to 24GB on the baseline since I don�t use more than about 150GB of storage at most times.,1,Justin Latham,2022-06-08T23:29:25Z,0,0.0,0.4370240870240869,0.4171328671328671;;",2022-03-08T19:45:19Z,7,8

4544,"I had the exact same thought while watching the keynote about the M2 MB pro. Seems like an insanely niche audience. Weird they didn�t update the design of it either. From what I can tell, it�s the only �recent� MacBook with the older design and what not.

They should have updated the bezels, added M2 with active cooling, MagSafe, and a 1080p camera. Then it would be a reasonable upgrade. But for me, with its current specs, design, and appearance, it�s not even a consideration. I would either do the M2 air for $1200 or the 14� MB Pro with M1 Pro for $2k. 
The M2 MB pro just seems like it�s in limbo� like if it was a 2 year old device already that just needed the updated design and such, that�s what it seems like; but it�s �brand new��
Very, very odd of Apple. 

I think it�s time for a CEO change. Bring in someone younger, that wants to release feature packed software/hardware, that wants to make �pro� devices pro, give us some extra pro software to go along with our �pro� hardware. Listen to your customer base on features that we�ve been begging for for years and years.

+ My other thought is that Apple currently has as wide portfolio of premium laptops as it can ever have.

That being said I'll probably buy a 16/256 m2 air at $1400 because paying $200 for an extra 256gb of OK performing storage is insane.

4805,"How To Go To Heaven
������It is very simple to be saved and takes only a minute to explain.�Please let me show you how to get�to�Heaven�from the Bible, God's Word...

Man is a�Sinner�in the Eyes of a Holy God.

Isaiah 53:6, �All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.�Romans 3:19, �Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the�world may become guilty before God.�John 3:3, �Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.�Romans 3:10, �As it is written,�There is none righteous, no, not one.�Romans 3:23, �For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.�

There�is a Price For Our Sin?Burning in Hell Forever.��

Romans 6:23, �For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.�Romans 5:12, �Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and�death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.�2nd Thessalonians 1:8, �In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.�Revelation 20:15, ""And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was�cast into the lake of fire.�Revelation 21:8, �But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in�the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.�

Jesus paid that price�by dying�on�the cross�and shedding His blood; Christ was buried and bodily rose again the third day!

Romans 5:8, �But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,�Christ died for us.�John 3:16, �For God so loved the world, that�he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.�1st Timothy 1:15, �This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that�Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.�1st Peter 1:18-19, �Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not�redeemed�with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;�But with the precious blood of Christ...�1st Corinthians 15:1-4,��Moreover, brethren,�I declare unto you�the gospel�which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that�Christ died�for our sins according to the scriptures; And that�he was buried, and that�he rose again the third day�according to the scriptures.� This is the Gospel.

By faith in Jesus Christ�ALONE�we�are immediately�saved.Galatians 3:26, �For ye are all the children of God�by faith in Christ Jesus.�John 11:25, �Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life:�he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.�John 6:28-29, �Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them,�This is the work of God, that ye believe on him�whom he hath sent.�Ephesians 2:8-9, �For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.�John 14:6, �Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father,�but by me.�John 6:40, �And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son,�and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.�Mark 1:15, �And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand:�repent ye, and believe the gospel.�Acts 26:18, �To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified�by faith that is in me.�Romans 10:13, �For whosoever shall call upon the�name of the Lord�shall be saved.�1st Corinthians 3:11, ""For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid,�which is Jesus Christ.�Galatians 3:26, �For ye are all the children of God�by faith in Christ Jesus.�

Salvation is NOT found in a religion or good works, but in a�Person...�The LORD JESUS CHRIST!

4852,"I'll admit, as a programmer, I kind of miss the Touch Bar after moving to a 14"" MBP from an older Touch Bar 15"" MBP. I know, programmers usually are known to hate the Touch Bar, but there were a lot of unique functionality that are hard to find on non-Touch Bar MacBooks. I liked that when you are debugging code in Xcode, it allows you to pause/set breakpoints/etc without it in focus. The screenshot taking button on Touch Bar is excellent and much better than memorizing hotkeys. And the spelling completion on the Touch Bar makes typing emojis much more seamless than having to do Cmd-Ctrl-Space on a regular keyboard. Some programming apps also have custom support for Touch Bar as well so you can add buttons to do the things you want. Oh well, I think the boat has sailed.

On the pricing front for M2, it's important to note that the M2 MacBook Air isn't really cheaper than the MacBook Pro if you upgrade SSD / RAM to the same spec.

4905,"Personally I'm not too fond of the new MacBook designs, the reason being that they feel very 90's esque, while that wave has come and went, it just seems as a way to do something unexpected, which imo is a huge Stepdown from previous generations innovative ideas. 

It is though interesting seeing apple switching from Jonathan Ives clean minimalist, durable and timeless designs over to computers which are more ""in"" or ""out"" and feels almost retro, which means that in a couple of years people are gonna be thinking macbooks of today look out of style because they are too in style with the trends of 2022 or imo the last couple of years. To me it seems as yet another weapon to nodge consumers to buy products more frequently, because they lost consumers on the right to repair loss.

I have been watching what Apple has been doing the last 10 years with a keen eye, and have been full of joy each time they kept on innovating. To me the peak has to be the release of the M1 Mac, where they simplified the computer down to 2 usbc ports, as well as iPhones getting simplified down to a wireless charger and complete minimalism. 

To me this seems like a huge step in the wrong direction of cables and clutter. The next few years we are probably gonna see a teardown of what I've has built over the last 10 years, in an attempt to create ""tech fashion"" where technology will get replaced like fashion every few seasons, not because of necessity, but because of greed by Apple. 

This comment has gotten very out of hand, and I just wanted to say that I didn't like the comparison between the two computers, beacuase it is very subjective. Subjective things should never be graphed nor have green checks as it decieves vision of the viewer.

I don�t think Apple even wants to make more sales on 13 inch MacBook Pro it is there to lead people the direction they anticipate people to go. This is marketing choice.,2022-03-08T17:44:45Z,11,8

5039,"Concerning the pricing and how Europeans (such as myself) are complaining about the price increases and many Americans telling us that we are forgetting about VAT not being included.

I posted this as a reply on a comment before but I would like to add it for everyone to see:


German here, let's do a quick calculation for everybody saying that we forget about VAT not being included.

MacBook Air M1 is 1199�: $999 + highest sales tax in the US (Tennessee 9.55%) = $1094,4045 which is 1.018,67� so 180.33�/ $193,74 cheaper.

Both can be bought cheaper if not bought directly from Apple but I chose consistent Apple pricing.

MacBook Air M2 is 1499�: $1199 + highest sales tax in the US (Tennessee 9.55%) = $1313,5045 which is 1.222,61� so 276,39�/ $296,94 cheaper.

The argument of forgetting about added VAT is totally invalid because it is still going to be way cheaper in the end. The least of you (which I think is a fair assumption to make) live in Tennessee, which has the absolute highest VAT. Even your highest VAT is almost exactly half of what German VAT is (19%).,1,pennerman,2022-06-08T22:00:37Z,0,0.0,0.4435897435897437,0.1348484848484848;;",2022-03-08T17:57:17Z,13,5

As it goes, I went for it (much to the annoyance of my wife) and have had it since October.  All of a sudden, for the 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage by themselves it doesn't look like terrible value when you then consider the better display, speakers and of course the M1 Pro.  My advice to would-be buyers of this new MBA thinking about RAM and/or storage upgrades is to consider the 14"" which may not be as far from the upgraded price of the Air as they imagine.,0,Greg Ayres,2022-06-08T21:48:03Z,2,1.0,0.5767508417508417,-0.0065488215488215;;",2022-03-08T17:32:17Z,6,7

5189,@Harry S Not very. You can look it up. The only modification is pulling off the factory thermal pad and putting on a thicker one that connects the processor directly to the chassis as a giant heatsink. You could save the pad and put it back if you wanted to. Only downside is that the bottom of the case directly under the cpu can get pretty hot (40C+) which could burn you if you leave it on your lap for a long time. I work on a desk/table most of the time and its raised on its rubber feet so I don't have an issue with the heat.,2022-03-08T17:32:09Z,18,3

I'm a web developer and unless you are doing game or graphics-heavy development, an M2 Air is the ideal setup for most users. When looking at the M1 Pro or Max chips, they are overkill for anyone who doesn't have a graphics-intensive workflow.

Side note: I think the fingerprint magnet is a feature of the way the metal feels on the newer-design-language Macbooks, but certainly the darker color might show it more.

5324,Apparently you don�t really need 16Gb in a MBA accord to Maxtech as the in-chip ram is so much better. Again Apple makes a great product but it has some fatal flaw or way expensive but unique like the Studio Display,2022-03-09T01:36:09Z,6,2
5325,"@Evsual ""because they've made the laptop itself significantly faster"" ...  Significantly faster? No they did not. This is a 2 year product cycle update, as people seem to forget that the M1 came out in 2020. Your getting 18% faster MT, what is mostly located on the E-Cores ( in other words, you do not feel any faster response there ). that increased 40% performance but those E-Cores are so dog slow from the start, even with 40% they are nowhere near useable for primary tasks. That leave you with the 4 Performance cores. The P-Cores are about 10% faster. Notice how Apple again mixes the marketing to fool people. 

The GPU has a 37% upgrade ( with a increased in power usage. Where its only a 25% if you want the same TDP). Given you have no fan, what do you think happens to a GPU that needs more power? Yep, it thermal throttles faster and that 37% will never be 37%. You need the Pro with the fan to get that benefit!

If we compare that to AMD 4800U to 6800U. They did a 28% faster ST, 46% faster MT, 115% faster GPU in that same timeframe. And they did not upgrade the OEM prices for those CPUs, while 16GB / 1TB has become a standard (aka free included ) feature on most laptops.

I am amazed at how little people understand of hardware and how easy they can be fooled to believe some marketing BS. O, M1 Max encodes as fast as a 3090. That means a M1 Max is as fast as a 3090 at gaming, right ( notice how Apple never answers those question and lets it up to the hype)? O, wait, it only performs as fast as a 1200 Euro laptop's 3050~3060 ranged with actual games because its 3060 like hardware with a great media encoder. Its easy to fool people when they do not do research and 90% of the youtubers constantly post only the good parts that Apple want them to focus on ( i wonder why? Might have something to do with Access to Apple and hardware? ;-0 ),1,Ben Jiro,2022-06-09T12:38:48Z,2,,0.5652116402116403,0.2190696649029982;;",2022-03-08T18:43:16Z,7,2

5550,I have always wondered why this channel has so many followers.   He offers no insight that you cannot get elsewhere with better analysis.     And that new Macbook Air is not a breakthrough product.   Why is is it that Apple continues to con people into buying two products when they could make one - a laptop with a touchscreen?   I know - it pads profit margins and cons koolaid drinkers into buying two products when one would work.    The dark color is also nice.  I'm not surprised a snowflake like him would not like it.,2022-03-22T21:25:10Z,16,3
5551,"I have a Starlight watch and think the colour is awesome. Not sure about so much a larger visual area of that shade, though. Otherwise I agree with your comments re the M2 MacBook Pro 13"" - I suspect they are covering their bases for the Touch Bar holdouts (or maybe a senior Apple employee is the holdout lol). I think further hardware releases this year might be a little more muted than normal due to supply chain issues.

This and many other things (like external SSD's stopping working after another brilliant update) made me switch to Surface Pro 8. This thing feels so much more futuristic and premium.

On my old Pro the display simply couldn't get bright enough to easily see at times, but on my new 14"" that's fixed with the new display. I use an app called Lunar to unlock max XDR brightness (1600 nits) at all times, which makes it super easy to see even in direct sunlight. At these brightness levels I consistently get 5-6 hours of battery life before I need to plug in, which is fantastic for working outdoors!

That said, I assume the Air works like the Pros and you can still charge it via USB-C, so there is no negative either. if you prefer just having the one cord to deal with, you can still do that.

MacBook Air M1 is 1199�: $999 + highest sales tax in the US (Tennessee 9.55%) = $1094,4045 which is 1.018,67� so 180.33�/ $193,74 cheaper.

Both can be bought cheaper if not bought directly from Apple but I chose consistent Apple pricing.

MacBook Air M2 is 1499�: $1199 + highest sales tax in the US (Tennessee 9.55%) = $1313,5045 which is 1.222,61� so 276,39�/ $296,94 cheaper.

The argument of forgetting about added VAT is totally invalid because it is still going to be way cheaper in the end. The least of you (which I think is a fair assumption to make) live in Tennessee, which has the absolute highest VAT. Even your highest VAT is almost exactly half of what German VAT is (19%).,1,pennerman,2022-06-08T21:57:59Z,9,,0.4333333333333333,0.1139118457300275;;",2022-03-09T16:12:14Z,13,3

6223,@Sandeep Sengupta some shots have a discoloration on the mid-left side of the screen. Looks to me like sensor-burn in one of his cameras,2022-03-09T08:23:35Z,20,7
6224,Actually looks like sensor because the framing is moving I believe due to the sensor IBIS and not IS on lens cause it'd move with the movement. Keen eye to catch that tho,2022-03-09T08:23:20Z,6,6

6238,I wish I hadn't seen this before I watched,2022-03-09T08:11:26Z,10,7
6239,@jay It wouldn't move with the zoom if it was on the sensor. It's likely between on the backside of the lens or between lens elements (which is honestly where that stuff tends to live and it's impossible to easily get rid of).,2022-03-09T08:07:40Z,10,4

I myself actually do not have a MacBook and am now considering buying one. For me the MacBook Air M2 visually very chic especially in the dark color. What�s also very charming is the MacBook is very light in weight and has no active cooling. So it is completely silent. However, I don't know how the performance would be without active cooling if I were to take part in a meeting with the camera activated via teams or use Final Cut from time to time....

If I hadn't seen some comparison videos now, I would buy MacBook Air M2 in the midnight color and additionally selected the larger GPU (10-core) incl. 16 GB RAM and 1 terabyte SSD. That would put the price at 2309 EUR. But now some say that you can directly get the MacBook Pro 14 inch, because I it costs 170 EUR more I guess and has more power and active cooling.
Now I am undecided ??.
I would use the MacBook privately and sometimes for work: Surfing, do office work (Word, Excel or even sometimes participate in meetings via teams) very rarely edit music or edit the one or other video with Final Cut.
I think the MacBook Air M2 with my configuration is enough, right?,1,Ali,2022-06-15T17:44:36Z,0,0.0,0.6043506493506494,0.1673051948051948;;",2022-03-08T23:11:24Z,11,7

Im glad they brought back the magnetic charging, I dont entirely understand why they removed it to begin with. Interesting that the laptop body picks up fingerprints so easily.

Disappointing that Apple didnt redesign the Mac Pro M2. I was interested in buying one for school work, currently I use a refurbed Dell laptop running RHEL. I would love to have a Mac to run MS applications & have a UNIX based OS, but I'm not interested in the lack of redesign for the M2 Pro.

7016,"Let me tell you the best in class use case. Back in 2015 I bought an Intel Macbook pro 15 inch on an in store deal for approx 1950. Back then, I needed portability due to the way the tech world was with office work and client visits. in 2020 we had the pandemic, and the world changed where we could work remotely, in fact it was encouraged. All of a sudden I could comfortably get by with having desktop. I then sold my 2015 Intel Macbook pro for 500 to a DJ. I bought an M1 Mac Mini for 550 and a used like new 32 inch AOC 4k monitor for 350. I had vouchers from work on Amazon as a bonus and used that to buy a Keychron keyboard, a Logitech MX Master and a Dprofy soundbar. 

Honestly, I have no intention to change for a good while no matter how many events Apple has. That is how you get the optimum out of Apple without spending too much.

You can enter the app, but you can also reply in the notification. Like.... WTF???? I want things central and not spread out in multiple levels. But that bar is nothing, compared to flat design. It is like MS and Apple said ""fuck it, we use it so heavy that people dont know what is a function/feature anymore"". And I hate that aproach the industry have taken to heart. Like in Win10, in settings, it took me 30 minute to figure out that a line of text were like a button or something. When things are that heavily used, it is bad for the user experience.

IMHO  moving to the M2 in the MB 13in Pro was a no brainer plus its would be strange if the Pro was less powerful than the Air and could do less stuff.Who would buy the 13in Pro??? Perhaps Apple had to guarantee its developers that the touchbar would remain for likely Pro Apps until its dropped from them all. So it had to still sell the smaller/""lighter"" 13in MBP. Looking at the specs, I can see the 13in MBP being dropped first as the top end Air has the same specs (if not better and lighter). What customer needs a 10GPU M2 Macbook Air with a 2TB SSD/24GB RAM?

7972,"It's a little frustrating to me that people have these assumptions that all creative professionals will automatically buy the more expensive M1 Pro or M1 Max models and therefore there's no value on the M2 13 inch MacBook Pro update. There are plenty of photographers and others like me who are interested in finding the best performance and user experience at the most cost effective level, especially if it's required for your business to be efficient and profitable. The $500+ plus difference between the M2 13"" MBP and the M1 Pro 14"" MBP is a considerable chunk of change for a self employed photographer, which could be better spent on lenses or other gear. I'm not saying I wouldn't love an M1 Pro or Max laptop, but I wouldn't discredit the M2 MBP entirely for those who need sustained performance at the lowest price.

That said, I do think the M2 Air is the more intriguing machine now, although I find it hard to justify the price increase given the measly 8GB of memory and 256GB storage. Bump those up to a more reasonable starting size and the price would be easier to swallow.,1,Misterfilmguy,2022-06-09T20:09:57Z,0,1.0,0.5590579710144927,0.1643115942028985;;",2022-03-08T17:29:56Z,18,8

And my opinion is strongly the second, as Apple wasn't so diffused a few years back... - same goes within its lineup. _MOST_ people who buy the Pro is because they want the pro/serious image, and those buy the Air want to have the more air/traveller image.... the price is not really a problem, 1400 or 1600 doesn't really make a difference, does it?

It' partly because of the inflation, the value of the dollar has dropped by ~8% so if you wanted to buy the M1 you should pay 1087$ instead of 999$(so the fact that the price stayed stable is the discount from Apple XD). However Apple is taking advantage of the fact that the demand would be high and jacked up the price for the M2 by ~100$ compared  to the first gen apple silicon (the M1 had an ""introduction"" price).,1,?????? ?????????????????,2022-06-09T13:15:21Z,0,0.0,0.3244444444444443,0.1366666666666667;;",2022-03-12T00:07:13Z,12,2

8478,"I think we all agree that the 13"" M2 Pro is a deliberately poor laptop because of two reasons.
The first is the 'decoy pricing' many ppl have stated. The second I think is because the Apple silicon refresh cycle is a bit messy - because the M1 Pro and Ultra came out a whole year after the M1, what they need to say now is that the M2 is better than a chip from 2 yrs ago but *not* better than last year's chip...which is weird.
Plus having two ""Pro"" laptops with almost the same size (14"" vs 13.6"") makes no sense so I'm guessing they will align this to the M2 Pro next year or kill off the line.,1,Abdul Rahman Noor,2022-06-09T12:54:28Z,0,0.0,0.3687500000000001,0.0083333333333333;;",2022-03-11T10:39:22Z,16,8

8682,"What i dont understand about these tech reviewers that 3-4 years ago they were using the macbook pro 15/16� intel laptops with dedicated GPUs for heavy video editing and other stuff and when the base model m1 macbook air outperforms those same $4000 laptops, still they say it�s good enough for occasional video editing.
I find this funny that they always try to create line between an everyday user and a professional user instead of saying �essentially we were using less or equally powerful laptop as MBA m1/m2 to make these reviews, so yeah you can use it professionally�
Basically no matter how much they try most of them cannot get into the shoe of an avg user with tight budget who is working professionally and thriving financially using m1 base laptop which these reviewers deem to be for web browsing and not for so called YT professionals.
I guess thats cz they never had to squeeze the so called base model as they always have access to the latest models and subconsciously they are satisfying their own purchase of the m1 pro laptops although even they dont need m1pro to edit a 4k 10min review.

TBH even these big YTers also get into the trap of capitalism & consumerism and become the victims of marketing and not using and consider these machines as tools to solve problems and persuade their viewers into the same trap.,1,Balram Sharan,2022-06-09T10:41:59Z,0,0.0,0.4871252204585538,0.0214726631393298;;",2022-03-09T23:10:07Z,19,7

8884,The real question about the lineup is where the iPad air really fits in. If it can be placed properly in the Airline of products things make better sense in terms of the air serving nonpros as a continuous spectrum of products leading to the pro line with the Mac studio and the MacBook pro being the next steps up. The iPad Air actually sits between the M1 MacBook  Air and the M2 MacBook Air. This gives you air features and laptop capabilities depending on your use case. But I really think the iPad gets paired as a second device to whichever laptop you have not as a standalone unit unto itself. This is why running macOS on it makes no sense. If you want to run Pro Apps then get an M2 MacBook and keep the iPad for review and approvals or for prototyping and concept generation and content consumption. If you have an M1 then it is the carry-around on-the-go solution when you don't create or need a lot of typing.  It's too expensive when you add a pen and a keyboard to it compared to a laptop so don't make it one.,2022-03-09T09:08:47Z,14,4

My main point is that an extra 2 ports would cost apple very little to implement, but they haven't done it, presumably to drive people to the Pro line. Same with the single display limit. I understand why it is done but it is still quite annoying, as I don't really need the power of a pro chip but have to spend the extra money for I/O features that are present on windows laptops half the price. Still, that is the apple way!

8912,"@Robert Hunt for that use case you described here, Air is not the best option. For many other use cases for musicians, it is. Many of Apple users already have dongles purchased so there's no extra cost for getting some extra ports if needed. And I'm really not buying that latency argument, if you route your audio interface through a dongle or a dock. Any data on that?

The reason to buy an Air is definitely portability. If you move around a lot e.g., you're a dj, Air could be the perfect solution for you. In your case, it might not.

It baffles me people don't understand that there are lots of different use cases people have and I was pointing out musician requiring a portable solution with enough spec to run music production software.

9069,"Marques, I think you forgot that the 13"" macbook pro is still the best selling macbook pro by a huge margin. That is why they are limited on changing it too much. For now I assume. There is a huge segment of the market that hates the new design still. Chances are they have manufacturing contracts to fullfill with the older design still and back-log on manufacturing with that design especially with their rapid switch to cutting off intel. Apple is really dropping the ball in making the air without a 15"" option and moving pro to 15"" default and 17"" or more for higher end models. 13"" in 2022 feels super small really. These screens aren't much different than the largest ipad pro screen size and the ipad pro's honestly have a better looking screen without any doubt. Prices went up realistically due to the cost of manufacturing right now. Inflation is really bad. I work for a tech/power company (huge in every industry) and people cannot even fathom just how bad the supply chain and costs all around are. IT'S REALLY BAD.

9195,"Get the Minight MacBook Air, please! It's a new thing and also, I kinda have a different take on fingerprint smudges, scratches and dents: These are battle scars and make the device more ""yours"". They show that it's been loved and used with so much passion and has been through adventures and mishaps. They are more like memories etched on the device. My current laptop has a ton of scratches, dents and smudges, but each one tells a story and I wouldn't have my laptop any other way.

They are as unique as fingerprints. Each set of smudges, scratches and dents represents a unique personality and a unique story of friendship and partnership between the device and the user.

If you believe in this take, please always go for the colors you like and never think of the physical deformities that may be more evident due to that particular color.,1,Harshit Doshi,2022-06-09T06:18:55Z,0,0.0,0.5269209956709958,0.2392518939393939;;",2022-03-09T03:09:53Z,12,2

9209,I think Apple made one last old Macbook Pro for users who are more reluctant to changing to the new versions for some reason. I�m sure this is the last Macbook Pro in the old design and whoever gets it now knows that. I mean they made a chip transition and an aesthetic transition. For some that�s too much at once and they need a bit more time. Also the old macbook pro seems to be very popular even with the new models out cause of the price.

It sounds like a great deal on paper, but if you have an M1 Air (like I do), I don't really see much of a reason to upgrade, here are a few things they could have done to sweeten the deal a little bit:
- Quantum Dot LED
- ProMotion Display for better battery life
- Touchscreen
- Face ID
- One thunderbolt port on each side instead of both on one side
- A single USB-A port
- Start at 16GB RAM for the same price

9352,"Apple employee here! adding M2 chip to the mac book pro was unexpected for us. 
That was the las minute decision taken by the management team without informing the software team. Basically, hardware team is so confident that m1 chips can be easily replaced with M2 and that needs no additional testing. So there is no prototype for a MacBook pro with M2 yet. This decision was take to sell all the old hardware that was stock piled.

The plan for the cips are as follows
M2 - iPad pro, iPad air, Mac book Air, Mac mini
M2 pro - Mac book pro -14 & 16, iMac, Mac Studio
M2 max - Mac book pro -14 & 16, iMac, Mac Studio, Mac Pro
M2 ultra - iMac, Mac Studio, Mac Pro (focused mainly on gaming and content creation)
M2 ultra is going to destroy the gaming PC industry. We have our internal benchmark tool and it shows around 5 times better performance when compared to the best PC money can buy.,1,rahul A,2022-06-09T05:23:54Z,0,0.0,0.4444444444444445,0.2888888888888889;;",2022-03-08T22:49:09Z,6,2

9383,"Seems that comments about excessive pricing do not account for the cost issues facing every manufacturer of most any worthy item these days. Component shortages translate into manufacturing cost increases, compounded on top of the more generalized price increases we are all experiencing to an astonishing degree.  Apple's shift from prior anticipated pricing norms reflects the reality of running a successful business in these current poorly managed economic conditions.
As a consumer, an approach to coping with the problem is to future-proof purchases with upgrades that are likely to extend useful life.  So the M2 MB Air I order will likely be quite more expensive than the base, but yet a trivial price in my view since squeezing 13 years out of the trusty magsafe 5-pound aluminum tricked-out MBP with which I am composing this comment (yet destined, finally, to be retired by that worthy alternative)...its age a clear reflection of my own.

9484,"To me eyes, keeping the macbook pro 13� in the actual lineup is just part of neuromarketing strategy such as anchor pricing.  Let me explain futher:  

-So when we see this laptop still on sale we think �what an old fashioned and boring design� and it is even expensier than the All new Macbook Air, what?-same processor?! really!? hmm�. �. The next thing we would do is turn our sight back to the Macbook Air with its slick design & sexy midnight black color�MagSafe� a modern notch!(xD) and so on�easy piece! Buy the Air!. This way we momentarily forget that Apple raised its price tag tremendously with a 20% and/or we could say that it is worth it.   For anyone who still complains� well that is why they keep selling the M1 Air.   

I could be wrong of course, but If someone knows how to sell products and make good profit out of it, that is Apple. Hands down. And yeah they just mentioned it in the presentation, the Macbook Air is the MOST popular Apple laptop (If I remember right�), so do the math$$$. I mean is also a good product.

It doesn't even have full Photoshop, not to speak of the game engines I need. Buying iPad Pro for me would be like buying an expensive media consumption toy basically. It's more convenient anyways that my desktop, laptop and tablet are all the same system.

9600,"@PhazonBlaxor You are very right about the sortcuts but throughout the OS there are many menu�s that when you have them open you have to press �Option� for other alternatives, what is the philosophy for that, I don't know and it is actually something absurd. 

And I didn't say that Macos doesn't reserve junk files, just that I understand that Windows saves a lot more. In Macos Everything related to the applications is stored in the �library� �application support�, you delete the file and that's it. I have never understood why Macos does not have a dedicated application to uninstall applications. 

Surface is very elegant and functional but if I were to buy a tablet it would be an iPad M1 that also has a pen and keyboard and is fast. 

You're also right, PCs work a little better than before, but as I told you, that ""Frankenstein"" factor and constant virus scanning is a big no for me. I still have nightmares about ""ctrl+alt-del"" because Windows gets stuck and never recovers no matter how powerful the PC is. 

I like to be organized and I like Apple's approach to minimalism. Windows look and feel seems stuffy to me. The truth is that I am glad that both exist, I would also like Linux to open up more paths to have more alternatives, it is a matter of taste and that each one works for what we need. But if I have to present myself to a client and I have to bring my laptop, for nothing in the world would I like him to see me taking a plastic laptop out of my backpack.,1,Peter_Shadow,2022-06-12T16:00:38Z,0,,0.5304988662131519,0.1902210884353741;;",2022-03-10T10:07:34Z,18,7
9601,"@Peter_Shadow As an artist myself, Surface Pro 8 is so much better than Macbooks for me personally; it has touch and pen, makes a lot of difference.

Not sure how long it's been since you used Windows before, but it's come a long way. Everything just works and the hardware (at least in case of Surface) is premium and beautifuf. Windows 11 is quite elegant too, MacOS feels very inconsistent and unfinished to me, it never started making that much sense even after 6 years of using it. 

For instsnce, why is it that CMD + X and CMD + V does work for cutting and pasting EVERYWHERE except Finder? Why do I have to remember a special cutting key combination CMD + Option + C (I think it was?) to do the same thing just there? 

Speaking of crap files, why does MacOS not remove all the files when I remove an application? I have HALF of my SSD filled in this mysterious section called ""Other"" when I look at the storage manager. After a lot of Googling and folder exploring I discovered that I have my Mac littered with old files from old programs that MacOS hasn't bothered to remove despite me uninstalling the software assosiacted with the files long ago. It's impossible to remove all of the files since I have no clue where everything is, what is important and what isn't � this has happened with multiple software and is super annoying.

Then I hate that some apps do not maximize properly. It's inconsistent. Like Lightroom does maximize, but Photoshop doesn't. I guess this has to do with the developers themselves, but in Windows when I press that same button I know exactly what's going to happen. Same goes for the X button, how it works on MacOS is highly inconsistent, some apps minimize for no clear reasoning while some apps close.

Windows has its own share of BS, but MacOS feels like multiple people programming a software and nobody communicating to each other, resulting in a total mess. 

I suppose these are matters of taste, I can understand why people do like Macs. It's an experience all the way from unboxing to using the device. They are well built hardware wise and apparently some people like MacOS (for reasons I'm not understanding).,0,PhazonBlaxor,2022-06-12T14:58:55Z,0,,0.5235849787069299,-0.0184843205574912;;",2022-03-09T00:11:01Z,5,7
9602,"@PhazonBlaxor Wow, what a lot of misadventures you had. Big Sur had a lot of problems, as did Catalina. It is rare that you have had so many problems since Apple is the Standard system in the art industry. Safari is my preferred browser and as soon as I started using Big Sur, Safari was not the same, but as updates came it got better. Many errors also happen because the applications we use are not ready for a new operating system. In 15+ years using Apple absolutely no problems other than that.

When I worked as a sound engineer I built a PC with the latest on the avenue for that time and I could never work in peace, it crashed, warning windows all the time, anti virus updates among other situations. I bought a basic iMac and my damn problems are over. I sold the PC crap for 1/4 of what it cost me, I just didn't want to hear about it.

I can't stand Windows, they store a lot of crap files and I don't trust that the video card is made in the North Pole with some standards, the processor in the South Pole with other standards and the Motherboard in the Bermuda Triangle with other standards.

Then there was the brilliant update after which only ""App Store and Verified Developers"" can be allowed automatically. It broke my Unity project, causing tens of compiling errors from burst packages and forces me to go to settings to allow EACH bundle MANUALLY every single time I make even one change in the code. Safari crashes instantly when opening, it was also a side effect from one of the updates but wasn't that big of a deal since I was using Chrome anyways.

9626,"@PhazonBlaxor Ah, nice to see Microsoft built in some touch specific improvements. I really think they need to just come out with a brand new from scratch OS and then do 2-3 years of supporting both Win 11 and Win X before sunsetting Win 11 and using just the new OS from that point on. I know legacy support is important to them, but I think it holds them back a lot, too. Windows 8 I think was an attempt at that, but the backlash scared them into backing off where they were trying to go.

I couldn't draw a stick figure if my life depended on it, so I admit I'm not at all graphically knowledgable, but for touch and pen input wouldn't the iPad Pro be the better interface? I understand not wanting to have two devices if it could be avoided, but I thought Photoshop itself was just released for iPad. Like I imagine your computer interactions would fall into two distinct categories: 1) interacting with the system; 2) doing the drawing/art related stuff. I can't imagine pen + touch being better for interacting with the system itself (sending an email, changing settings, etc), but the actual drawing/creative work itself I'm sure is drastically improved by pen/touch compared to mouse/keyboard. 

Because of this, I think what Apple is doing with Continuity has so much potential. I can be using my Mac to type emails/send invoices; but then ideally I could fire up whatever art program I need to do creative work in and it would automatically activate the iPad so that I could use that touch/pen interface for that purpose. 

But again, I am not a graphic artist at all, so I am admittedly talking from outside the domain (I do software programming and dabble in music, but I suck at art).,1,Tommy Craft,2022-06-09T22:01:59Z,0,,0.4919536271808999,0.3328512396694215;;",2022-03-08T20:09:21Z,10,3
9627,"More likely just want to get rid of spare bodies and components in production, Mainly in chip and component shortage it�s a great choice to do. 

And off course changing the price doesn�t make sense for many reasons - Apple kept the price of the basic 1299 MBP since 2017 when they first released two versions of Macbook pro, it would be strange if they just suddenly shifted from years ahead planned pricing program. Second reason is simply because Air could never be more expensive than Pro because of the naming, that is why Macbook Pro stays even though it sells less it will probably sell enough for it to help with getting rid of spare parts and it is not going to burden the production problems of chips.

And honestly Apple �Wants to build and sell tons of Airs at high margins� is not really the case, the new Air has definitely the lowest margin from any of the 3 low grade computers Apple sells right now. 
The goal is to sell as many M1 Macbook Airs as possible because those are going to be some of the highest margin devices with the time they have been in production and that is the main reason why the new Air is 1199� to make the older one seem like a great deal and at the same time boosting margins in creation of a new device Apple has done the same thing in 2018 with the release of the first retina Macbook Air.

9628,"@Tommy Craft Windows 11 has larger hitboxes around everything so it's easier to touch things. The operating system itself is well optimized for touch now even without tablet mode (it makes much more sense that there is no separate tablet mode, IMO), I rarely use the device with keyboard and pen if I'm not docked � it's actually enjoyable as a tablet, and I've used a bunch of iPads and Android tablets in the past.

But app support for touch is still kinda meh. Many of the pro software I've used work weird with touch � photoshop is an exception, they actually have gestures for things like undo, which is super handy.

And I can see why you would think touch is pointless, but as a graphic designer touch + pen is a must-have feature compared to trackpad or mouse. 

Besides, wouldn't you as a consumer rather have one device that can do it all well, instead of having to buy and carry multiple devices? That's what I've loved about SP8, it replaced my MB Pro, my Android tablet, my desktop and my Wacom drawing tablet all in one strike. It's just convenient that I don't need to transfer files between devices anymore, and I got SP8 basically for free after I sold all the things it replaced. (Notice the point being: doing everything WELL. SP8 isn't as good with touch as iPad, but why does it have to be like this? Why can't we have the ultimate iPad that does it all?).

Honestly there is nothing Pro about 13"" MacBook Pro. I'm utterly disappointed with apple keeping the M1 Air price same and M2 Air price way higher than expected. In India they are already too expensive and now by seeing this price I have to buy an Old M1 MacBook or stick to Windows Laptop. 
For example- $999 is ?77k actual conversion. But on apple India site it sells for ?99k ($1287). Similar with other products.
And infact an average Indian student  bought a laptop of ?50-60k ($640-780).

9816,"I was on the fence about buying a 14"" mbp, but than i thought ""why not wait for the m2 air?!"". Now i am kinda disappointed. In Germany i can get my hands on a 14"" mbp for 2000� (2250� on apples website) and the air costs 1500� (incl. tax). Now i would love to have 512gb / 16gb, which is base for the 14"" mbp, but this bumps the price of the air to 1960�, which is basically 40� difference to the mbp, bcs that one got cheaper buying from other shops than apple.

Now the air does not even have the nice screen of the mbp, which is one of the main reasons i am even considering an apple laptop for the first time ever, the other reason being the m1. I like the new air, but the price is just stupid. So i would rather be inclined to just spend 2k instead on the mbp...,0,Maximilian Schmidt,2022-06-12T15:31:47Z,0,,0.6221212121212121,-0.0946969696969697;;",2022-03-08T18:55:19Z,10,2

9820,"Apple most likely makes more money of a $1499 Air than a $1499 Pro. One of the Pros, on his list was size/weight. The Air being smaller takes less aluminum to build and that would cut the cost. The Air also has a smaller or not as high quality battery, the higher quality or more quantity of lithium would cause the Pro to cost more to make. The cost of fans, this is probably a not as costly, but is some what costly, and also is a contributor to needing a bigger laptop which goes back to more aluminum. Marques said that he up graded the Air to make them the same price, in reality; Apple offers a version of the M2 Air for $1499 (M2 8core CPU, 10core GPU, 8gb Unified Memory (Ram), 512gb SSD storage). The M2 Pro also has an option for $1499 (M2 8core CPU, 10core GPU, 8gb Unified Memory (Ram), 512gb SSD storage). These are the exact same stats almost. The fans are going to allow better performance continually. Also the Marques has the ports as better on the M2 Air, they actually have the exact same ports, except the M2 Pro has not mag port. Also you are not getting more screen, the expansion from 13.3 to 13.6 is true but you will have a line at the top due to the cameras and sensor bar stuck in the middle. Do you really need a 1080p webcam? Do you like the Touch Bar? These are question you have to ask yourself. I can tell you that the M2 Pro is a better deal if you do light video editing or creating, you might want 16gb ram though, but you would need that upgrade on both making them the same price. Creators are not using a webcam either or the mics; although, the mics on the M2 Pro are better, they are 3 studio quality mics, the Air's 3 mics are not studio quality, or Apple would list it as such. Also the M2 Air has 4 speakers system, but the M2 Pro has Stereo Speakers with High Dynamic Rang, this is not in the description of the M2 Air. A lot of creators also like the Touch Bar, that is a personal preference. For the Money, M2 Pro is a better though.,1,Rory Russell,2022-06-11T08:20:00Z,0,,0.3821171171171171,0.2115765765765766;;",2022-03-08T18:53:12Z,5,8

9858,"@Adam Frank Agree with this totally.  This is my thinking.  By the time you've looked at perhaps 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage, neither of which are outlandish specs, you're getting pretty close to the 14"" in price which unless you're desperate for an incredibly lightweight machine is a far more capable machine than a specced out Air.  Better processor, no throttling, better, bigger display etc.  Also likely to stay fast for longer and be worth far more for resale.  TBH, I don't stretch my 14"" but I still feel it was probably the right choice long term to swallow hard and pay the money.

10110,I'm more excited to see a comparison between M1 pro base model and new M2 Mac Air with 16 gigs unified memory and same external memory of 512 gigs.

10112,"And it has a better contrast, OLED like, miniLED screen, adaptive 120hz refresh rate, HDMI and SD card slots, 3 USB-C with dual sided charging, thinner bezels, slightly larger screen, likely better performance and beefier GPU, 2 fans for active cooling and the ability to run a dual monitor setup. I wouldn�t considering anything less than 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD and in that sense I�m glad I got the baseline Pro 14 and didn�t wait for this Air -

10185,I�m honestly more curious about the durability of the finish on the midnight model. And I feel it would look nicer with a skin since it would look less too tone that you get with space grey with a black skin. That being said space grey has always been my go too for Apple devices for a long time so I�m a bit torn.

I don�t know how the M1 Pro and M2 compare, I�d assume M1 Pro is still significantly better, but I�d say the main advantage to the 14� would be the display and speakers. However, I think it�s only slightly thinner than my 16� which is already pretty chunky. This is really weird but if you get the 14�, prepare for your computer to be fat shamed.

10233,Dude apple brought back the MagSafe to the laptop just to make up the money they going to lose once the iPhone get usb type c because of the eu laws.

10235,"Straight up I think Apple just bungled product release. 

I was expecting the MacBook Air to debut with the same colors as the M1 iMac lineup from last spring. And for the MacBook Pro to look like the lineup we�re getting with the M2 MacBook Air. Such a variety falls in line with the same color scheme Apple releases with the iPhone and iPhone pros. 

I think this has a lot to do with the supply chain issues that have been affecting the whole industry. Apple which has been able to stay ahead is now In the same boat as its competitors. Because Apple always feels the need to have to release something eye-catching during the developer conference, I think they prematurely released this line Under pressure To get new products out to market to maintain its profit margins.,1,Brian Castro,2022-06-09T02:06:16Z,0,1.0,0.3134680134680134,0.1151515151515151;;",2022-03-08T17:58:01Z,18,2

Most screen protectors get so scratched that the screen is no longer clear after a short period of time. I believe this is a scam to get people to keep buying screen protectors.

10418,"I can't figure out what the sweet spot configuration for this device is. I feel that if you're going to beef up the specs you should opt for an m1 pro. I'd assume that the 10 core, 16gb memory, and 1tb storage would be the best all around configuration for most people.

If you're a developer xcode is 40gb
MacOS itself is 40gb installed

If you're a photographer or video editor then you're probably working off a dongle because your files are on a card. Raw photos are 40mb and if you shot 2000 photos that's 80gb. And 1 hour 4k video is 3 gb. So say you're doing all of that, that's ~160gb.
I heard that the 1tb drive has faster speeds than the 512gb.

If when people were reviewing the m1 pro and were saying that 16gb ram is enough then 16gb ram is enough here.,1,kayseeday,2022-06-09T01:30:38Z,0,1.0,0.4852564102564102,0.2698717948717948;;",2022-03-08T19:14:08Z,11,4

10808,I thought the Macbook Pro 14 inch was supposed to replace the Pro 13 inch so I got really confused when they updated it. It feels strange in the line-up. I see no reason to pick up the Pro 13 over the new Air or Pro 14. I guess you would only get it if you absolutely cannot stand having a notch on your laptop.,2022-05-11T19:48:33Z,20,3

I also have the M1 Ultra 16 inch MacBook Pro and dislike the thickness and sharp front edge on my hands and wrists. It�s still some of that classic Apple form over function poor choices left over from the Jobs era. How hard would it be to radius the front edge in their machining process?,2022-05-06T08:08:49Z,12,4

10940,"Solid upgrade. Bummed to see a price hike but given the current economic environment I�m sure that apple is already swallowing costs and managing how much to pass on to consumers. 

My interpretation is that Apple seems to be using the baseline M2 MacBook Pro as a decoy to push people towards either end of the spectrum. People who want the convenience for a bargain will be pushed to buy the M2Air for slightly cheaper, which will likely provide higher higher margins than the pro for Apple. People who really seek performance are likely to go M1Pro or Ultra (maybe M2 pro or ultra when/if that is unveiled) which moves customers up the pricing ladder.

Apple has a genius marketing team and wouldn�t be against doing something to that affect!,1,Chance Curry,2022-06-08T23:39:09Z,2,0.0,0.4686868686868687,0.1303030303030303;;",2022-03-22T13:32:48Z,12,2

They should also just own up to the fact that they�re doing that and sell those machines for a better deal.

While I do use FCP and Motion every once and a while for motion graphics or prototyping, it�s not often and it�s handled those situations very well.

11072,"I had the exact same thought while watching the keynote about the M2 MB pro. Seems like an insanely niche audience. Weird they didn�t update the design of it either. From what I can tell, it�s the only �recent� MacBook with the older design and what not.

They should have updated the bezels, added M2 with active cooling, MagSafe, and a 1080p camera. Then it would be a reasonable upgrade. But for me, with its current specs, design, and appearance, it�s not even a consideration. I would either do the M2 air for $1200 or the 14� MB Pro with M1 Pro for $2k. 
The M2 MB pro just seems like it�s in limbo� like if it was a 2 year old device already that just needed the updated design and such, that�s what it seems like; but it�s �brand new��
Very, very odd of Apple. 

I think it�s time for a CEO change. Bring in someone younger, that wants to release feature packed software/hardware, that wants to make �pro� devices pro, give us some extra pro software to go along with our �pro� hardware. Listen to your customer base on features that we�ve been begging for for years and years.

It might make use as an alternative computer for schools and companies those can't/don't want to afford 14"" MBPs and think of Airs as being insufficient in their performance and/or lacking in the image of being Pro.�

+ My other thought is that Apple currently has as wide portfolio of premium laptops as it can ever have. There is almost no price gap between each models whatsoever, it only depends on if you're willing to spend an additional $100 for higher-end model or if you're good with bigger RAM or storage at the same model.

11333,"How To Go To Heaven
������It is very simple to be saved and takes only a minute to explain.�Please let me show you how to get�to�Heaven�from the Bible, God's Word...

Man is a�Sinner�in the Eyes of a Holy God.

Isaiah 53:6, �All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.�Romans 3:19, �Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the�world may become guilty before God.�John 3:3, �Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.�Romans 3:10, �As it is written,�There is none righteous, no, not one.�Romans 3:23, �For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.�

There�is a Price For Our Sin?Burning in Hell Forever.��

Romans 6:23, �For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.�Romans 5:12, �Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and�death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.�2nd Thessalonians 1:8, �In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.�Revelation 20:15, ""And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was�cast into the lake of fire.�Revelation 21:8, �But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in�the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.�

Jesus paid that price�by dying�on�the cross�and shedding His blood; Christ was buried and bodily rose again the third day!

Romans 5:8, �But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,�Christ died for us.�John 3:16, �For God so loved the world, that�he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.�1st Timothy 1:15, �This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that�Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.�1st Peter 1:18-19, �Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not�redeemed�with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;�But with the precious blood of Christ...�1st Corinthians 15:1-4,��Moreover, brethren,�I declare unto you�the gospel�which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that�Christ died�for our sins according to the scriptures; And that�he was buried, and that�he rose again the third day�according to the scriptures.� This is the Gospel.

By faith in Jesus Christ�ALONE�we�are immediately�saved.Galatians 3:26, �For ye are all the children of God�by faith in Christ Jesus.�John 11:25, �Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life:�he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.�John 6:28-29, �Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them,�This is the work of God, that ye believe on him�whom he hath sent.�Ephesians 2:8-9, �For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.�John 14:6, �Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father,�but by me.�John 6:40, �And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son,�and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.�Mark 1:15, �And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand:�repent ye, and believe the gospel.�Acts 26:18, �To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified�by faith that is in me.�Romans 10:13, �For whosoever shall call upon the�name of the Lord�shall be saved.�1st Corinthians 3:11, ""For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid,�which is Jesus Christ.�Galatians 3:26, �For ye are all the children of God�by faith in Christ Jesus.�

Salvation is NOT found in a religion or good works, but in a�Person...�The LORD JESUS CHRIST!

11380,"I'll admit, as a programmer, I kind of miss the Touch Bar after moving to a 14"" MBP from an older Touch Bar 15"" MBP. I know, programmers usually are known to hate the Touch Bar, but there were a lot of unique functionality that are hard to find on non-Touch Bar MacBooks. I liked that when you are debugging code in Xcode, it allows you to pause/set breakpoints/etc without it in focus. The screenshot taking button on Touch Bar is excellent and much better than memorizing hotkeys. And the spelling completion on the Touch Bar makes typing emojis much more seamless than having to do Cmd-Ctrl-Space on a regular keyboard. Some programming apps also have custom support for Touch Bar as well so you can add buttons to do the things you want. Oh well, I think the boat has sailed.

11433,"Personally I'm not too fond of the new MacBook designs, the reason being that they feel very 90's esque, while that wave has come and went, it just seems as a way to do something unexpected, which imo is a huge Stepdown from previous generations innovative ideas. 

It is though interesting seeing apple switching from Jonathan Ives clean minimalist, durable and timeless designs over to computers which are more ""in"" or ""out"" and feels almost retro, which means that in a couple of years people are gonna be thinking macbooks of today look out of style because they are too in style with the trends of 2022 or imo the last couple of years. To me it seems as yet another weapon to nodge consumers to buy products more frequently, because they lost consumers on the right to repair loss.

I have been watching what Apple has been doing the last 10 years with a keen eye, and have been full of joy each time they kept on innovating. To me the peak has to be the release of the M1 Mac, where they simplified the computer down to 2 usbc ports, as well as iPhones getting simplified down to a wireless charger and complete minimalism. 

To me this seems like a huge step in the wrong direction of cables and clutter. The next few years we are probably gonna see a teardown of what I've has built over the last 10 years, in an attempt to create ""tech fashion"" where technology will get replaced like fashion every few seasons, not because of necessity, but because of greed by Apple. 

This comment has gotten very out of hand, and I just wanted to say that I didn't like the comparison between the two computers, beacuase it is very subjective. Subjective things should never be graphed nor have green checks as it decieves vision of the viewer.

I don�t think Apple even wants to make more sales on 13 inch MacBook Pro it is there to lead people the direction they anticipate people to go. This is marketing choice.,2022-03-09T09:43:06Z,7,7

11567,"Concerning the pricing and how Europeans (such as myself) are complaining about the price increases and many Americans telling us that we are forgetting about VAT not being included.

I posted this as a reply on a comment before but I would like to add it for everyone to see:


German here, let's do a quick calculation for everybody saying that we forget about VAT not being included.

MacBook Air M1 is 1199�: $999 + highest sales tax in the US (Tennessee 9.55%) = $1094,4045 which is 1.018,67� so 180.33�/ $193,74 cheaper.

Both can be bought cheaper if not bought directly from Apple but I chose consistent Apple pricing.

MacBook Air M2 is 1499�: $1199 + highest sales tax in the US (Tennessee 9.55%) = $1313,5045 which is 1.222,61� so 276,39�/ $296,94 cheaper.

The argument of forgetting about added VAT is totally invalid because it is still going to be way cheaper in the end. The least of you (which I think is a fair assumption to make) live in Tennessee, which has the absolute highest VAT. Even your highest VAT is almost exactly half of what German VAT is (19%).,1,pennerman,2022-06-08T22:00:37Z,0,0.0,0.4435897435897437,0.1348484848484848;;",2022-03-09T09:44:02Z,9,6

As it goes, I went for it (much to the annoyance of my wife) and have had it since October.  All of a sudden, for the 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage by themselves it doesn't look like terrible value when you then consider the better display, speakers and of course the M1 Pro.  My advice to would-be buyers of this new MBA thinking about RAM and/or storage upgrades is to consider the 14"" which may not be as far from the upgraded price of the Air as they imagine.,0,Greg Ayres,2022-06-08T21:48:03Z,2,1.0,0.5767508417508417,-0.0065488215488215;;",2022-03-09T05:58:11Z,10,8

11717,@Harry S Not very. You can look it up. The only modification is pulling off the factory thermal pad and putting on a thicker one that connects the processor directly to the chassis as a giant heatsink. You could save the pad and put it back if you wanted to. Only downside is that the bottom of the case directly under the cpu can get pretty hot (40C+) which could burn you if you leave it on your lap for a long time. I work on a desk/table most of the time and its raised on its rubber feet so I don't have an issue with the heat.,2022-03-09T05:48:00Z,5,3

I'm a web developer and unless you are doing game or graphics-heavy development, an M2 Air is the ideal setup for most users. When looking at the M1 Pro or Max chips, they are overkill for anyone who doesn't have a graphics-intensive workflow.

Side note: I think the fingerprint magnet is a feature of the way the metal feels on the newer-design-language Macbooks, but certainly the darker color might show it more.

11852,Apparently you don�t really need 16Gb in a MBA accord to Maxtech as the in-chip ram is so much better. Again Apple makes a great product but it has some fatal flaw or way expensive but unique like the Studio Display,2022-03-09T05:05:11Z,18,6
11853,"@Evsual ""because they've made the laptop itself significantly faster"" ...  Significantly faster? No they did not. This is a 2 year product cycle update, as people seem to forget that the M1 came out in 2020. Your getting 18% faster MT, what is mostly located on the E-Cores ( in other words, you do not feel any faster response there ). that increased 40% performance but those E-Cores are so dog slow from the start, even with 40% they are nowhere near useable for primary tasks. That leave you with the 4 Performance cores. The P-Cores are about 10% faster. Notice how Apple again mixes the marketing to fool people. 

The GPU has a 37% upgrade ( with a increased in power usage. Where its only a 25% if you want the same TDP). Given you have no fan, what do you think happens to a GPU that needs more power? Yep, it thermal throttles faster and that 37% will never be 37%. You need the Pro with the fan to get that benefit!

If we compare that to AMD 4800U to 6800U. They did a 28% faster ST, 46% faster MT, 115% faster GPU in that same timeframe. And they did not upgrade the OEM prices for those CPUs, while 16GB / 1TB has become a standard (aka free included ) feature on most laptops.

I am amazed at how little people understand of hardware and how easy they can be fooled to believe some marketing BS. O, M1 Max encodes as fast as a 3090. That means a M1 Max is as fast as a 3090 at gaming, right ( notice how Apple never answers those question and lets it up to the hype)? O, wait, it only performs as fast as a 1200 Euro laptop's 3050~3060 ranged with actual games because its 3060 like hardware with a great media encoder. Its easy to fool people when they do not do research and 90% of the youtubers constantly post only the good parts that Apple want them to focus on ( i wonder why? Might have something to do with Access to Apple and hardware? ;-0 ),1,Ben Jiro,2022-06-09T12:38:48Z,2,,0.5652116402116403,0.2190696649029982;;",2022-03-09T04:07:42Z,14,6

It�s literally more screen all over and NOT the notch cutting �into� the screen.
